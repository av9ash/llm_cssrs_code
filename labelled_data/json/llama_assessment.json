Thus, **Q1**: The user has expressed a wish to not be alive.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** (Severity: 2)\nThe user mentions, \"Last year I tried taking a whole bottle of pills,\" indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves and have acted on them in the past. Thus, **Q2**: The user has had thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** (Severity: 3)\nThe user is asking, \"Does anyone know what pills will actually do the job? Or maybe how many pill bottles?\" which indicates they are thinking about how to kill themselves. Thus, **Q3**: The user is thinking about the method.\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** (Severity: 4)\nThe user's statement, \"I can\u2019t take it anymore,\" and their inquiry about effective methods for suicide indicate an intention to act on these thoughts. The fact that they previously attempted suicide also suggests a history of intending to act on such thoughts. Thus, **Q4**: The user has had thoughts with some intention of acting on them.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"** (Severity: 5)\nThe user is seeking specific information about the quantity and type of pills needed, indicating they are in the process of working out the details. Thus, **Q5**: The user is working out the details.\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"** (Severity: 6)\nAlthough there's no explicit statement that they have started or prepared to do something to end their life recently, the fact that they are inquiring about specifics suggests they are on the path to potentially doing so. However, there's no clear evidence they have taken concrete steps (like acquiring the pills). Thus, **Q6**: N/A, as there's no direct evidence of having done or started anything.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the post meets the criteria for **Q1** through **Q5**. The user has expressed a wish to die, had thoughts about killing themselves, is considering how to do it, has some intention of acting on these thoughts, and is working out the details.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user has expressed a wish to not be alive.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user has had thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user is thinking about the method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user has had thoughts with some intention of acting on them.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The user is working out the details.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the user has started to work out the details of how to kill themselves and has a history of attempting suicide, indicating a significant level of suicidal intent and planning, even though there's no clear evidence they've taken concrete steps recently."

The statement \"i\u2019m just so fuckinf tired of being a burden to everyone in my life\" suggests a deep emotional distress. Thus, it can be inferred that the person might be wishing they weren't alive or didn't have to deal with the perceived burden they feel they are. \n   - \"Q1\": The post implies the person has wished they weren't a burden, aligning with wishing they were dead or not awake.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The possession of a significant quantity of paracetamol (35 x 500mg = 17.5g, which is a potentially lethal dose) alongside the expression of being tired of being a burden suggests that the person might be considering suicide as an option to end their perceived burden on others. This indicates they have had thoughts about killing themselves.\n   - \"Q2\": The mention of having a large quantity of paracetamol and feeling like a burden implies thoughts about using it potentially for suicide.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   The fact that the person has a large quantity of paracetamol (enough to be potentially lethal) at their disposal implies they have been thinking about how to end their life, with paracetamol overdose being a method considered.\n   - \"Q3\": Having 35 tablets of 500mg paracetamol suggests they have thought about using it to end their life.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   The statement does not directly indicate an immediate intention to act, but the presence of a lethal quantity of paracetamol and the emotional state described suggests an intention or at least a serious consideration.\n   - \"Q4\": The context suggests an intention might be present, given the quantity of paracetamol and the emotional distress.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   The possession of a potentially lethal dose of paracetamol implies some level of planning. However, the post does not explicitly state that they have worked out all the details or intend to carry out the plan immediately.\n   - \"Q5\": Having a potentially lethal dose suggests some planning, but the post doesn't confirm if they have fully worked out the details or intend to act.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   The post mentions having a significant quantity of paracetamol but does not indicate that they have taken it or made any immediate preparations to take it.\n   - \"Q6\": There's no indication they have taken or prepared to take the paracetamol at the time of posting.\n\n**Severity Assessment:**\nGiven the information and the steps analyzed, the severity can be determined based on the highest level of criteria met. The person has implied thoughts of suicide (Q2), considered a method (Q3), and has access to a potentially lethal means (implying some level of planning, Q5). However, there's no direct indication they've taken concrete steps to end their life (Q6).\n\nThe response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies the person has wished they weren't a burden, aligning with wishing they were dead or not awake.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The mention of having a large quantity of paracetamol and feeling like a burden implies thoughts about using it potentially for suicide.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"Having 35 tablets of 500mg paracetamol suggests they have thought about using it to end their life.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The context suggests an intention might be present, given the quantity of paracetamol and the emotional distress.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Having a potentially lethal dose suggests some planning, but the post doesn't confirm if they have fully worked out the details or intend to act.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"There's no indication they have taken or prepared to take the paracetamol at the time of posting.\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the individual has started to work out or has worked out the details of how to kill themselves (having a lethal dose of paracetamol), indicating a level of planning, though it's not explicitly stated they intend to carry out the plan."

However, the primary focus is on experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu related to dying rather than wishing to be dead. So, it's more related to the concept of dying than wishing to be dead. Hence, \"N/A\" might be a bit strict, but it's not a clear \"1\". Let's consider it as leaning towards a minimal indication, but not directly.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" \n   - The post mentions seeing oneself dying, which could imply thoughts about one's own death, but it doesn't directly indicate thoughts about killing oneself.\n   - \"Q2\": The statement does not directly indicate suicidal thoughts; it's more about experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu related to dying. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" \n   - There's no mention or implication of planning or thinking about methods of suicide.\n   - \"Q3\": \"N/A\" as there's no indication of this.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" \n   - The post doesn't indicate any intention to act on thoughts of dying or suicide.\n   - \"Q4\": \"N/A\".\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" \n   - There's no indication of planning or intending to carry out a suicidal act.\n   - \"Q5\": \"N/A\".\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" \n   - The statement doesn't suggest any action or preparation towards ending one's life.\n   - \"Q6\": \"N/A\".\n\nGiven the post's content, the closest related question is \"Q1\" because it involves a preoccupation or thought related to dying. However, it's not a direct wish to be dead or to not wake up; it's more about experiencing a phenomenon (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) related to dying.\n\nThe overall severity is somewhat related to the first question due to its focus on experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu related to dying, but it doesn't clearly fit into any of the categories directly.\n\nHere's the evaluation in the requested JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implies a thought related to dying but not a clear wish to be dead\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning for assigning a severity of \"1\" is that the post is somewhat related to the concept of dying or death, akin to the first question, but doesn't directly express a wish to be dead or not wake up. The experience described is more related to a perception or feeling rather than a clear suicidal ideation or intent. Therefore, while it's concerning and deserves attention, it's not directly aligned with the higher severity levels."

However, the emotional state described could be interpreted as a deep despair which might implicitly include such wishes. Still, it's not directly stated.\n   - \"Q1\": \"N/A\" (because it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or sleep and not wake up)\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThere's no direct mention or implication of thoughts about killing oneself in the post. The focus is on feeling low and seeking reassurance.\n   - \"Q2\": \"N/A\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?

Severity: 6**\nThere's no indication of any action or preparation towards ending one's life.\n   - \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nThe post indicates a state of distress and low mood but does not directly fulfill any of the criteria related to suicidal thoughts or actions as outlined in the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. However, the expression of being \"so low\" could imply a risk that warrants attention.\n\nGiven the information and the scale:\n- The post does not directly relate to suicidal thoughts or actions but indicates a need for support or reassurance, suggesting some level of distress.\n- The closest related severity is 1, but even that is not directly supported because the post doesn't explicitly wish to be dead or sleep and not wake up.\n\nThus, we assign a severity level based on the information provided and the context:\n- Since there's no explicit suicidal ideation or behavior mentioned, but the post does convey a significant level of distress, the severity is not 0 (not related to suicide). However, it doesn't fit directly into any of the severity categories as it doesn't explicitly mention suicidal thoughts or actions.\n\nResponse in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nJustification for \"severity\": 1 - While the post doesn't directly fulfill the first criterion, it implies a deep emotional low, which is the closest related concern among the given metrics. The individual is expressing a need for reassurance (\"tell me it's going to be okay\"), indicating a level of distress that could be associated with the kind of negative self-feeling that underlies the first question. However, it's a stretch, and ideally, such a post should be taken seriously and responded to with support, even if it doesn't directly indicate suicidal ideation. A more conservative or clinical interpretation might still rate it as 0 if strictly adhering to the absence of direct suicidal ideation or intent. For the purpose of this exercise and given the template constraints, assigning a \"1\" reflects an understanding that the post indicates significant distress, even if not directly suicidal."

Severity: 1**\nThe post states, \"I'm so suicidal rn,\" which indicates a current state of suicidality. The term \"suicidal\" can imply a range of thoughts or feelings related to suicide, potentially including wishing to be dead. Thus, it fulfills the criteria for having wished to be dead or not wake up. \n\"Q1\": The post implies the user is experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings, so it's related to wishing to be dead or not wake up.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post directly implies suicidality (\"I'm so suicidal rn\"), which could be interpreted as having thoughts about killing oneself, as it's a common understanding that being \"suicidal\" involves such thoughts.\n\"Q2\": The statement \"I'm so suicidal\" can be associated with thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no explicit mention of thinking about the method to end one's life.\n\"Q3\": N/A, as there's no specific mention of thinking about the method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post doesn't directly indicate an intention to act on suicidal thoughts; it asks \"how can I relax,\" which suggests a desire to alleviate their current distress.\n\"Q4\": N/A, as there's no clear indication of having an intention to act on the thoughts.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication that the user has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan.\n\"Q5\": N/A, as there's no mention of planning.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post doesn't indicate that the user has taken any action towards ending their life; instead, it seeks help on how to relax.\n\"Q6\": N/A, as there's no indication of taking action.\n\nThe overall severity is determined by the highest level of severity that is clearly indicated by the post. The post implies the presence of suicidal thoughts or feelings (Severity: 2) but does not clearly indicate having a plan or taking action.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format, based on the given template, is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies the user is experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings, so it's related to wishing to be dead or not wake up.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement 'I'm so suicidal' can be associated with thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

It doesn't directly fulfill the criteria.)\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** The post doesn't directly state that the author has had thoughts about killing themselves.

The mention of \"I've been there\" could imply some level of personal experience, but it's not clear or directly related to the current state of the author's suicidal thoughts or intentions. The primary concern and content of the post are about supporting a friend, not expressing current suicidal thoughts or behaviors."

Severity:1**\n   - The post does not directly state that the person has wished they were dead or wished to go to sleep and not wake up. However, it mentions thinking about suicide, which could be related. The question seems to be more about the implication of having such thoughts rather than a direct expression of wishing to be dead.

Trust me, a infection is by far the worst way to go out. You will hate yourself more if you self harm, try to be with people, you don't have to talk all the time because just being with them will greatly reduce the urge to self harm.",

However, the context implies a severe negative emotional state. Thus, it's related but not directly answering this question. **Q1: N/A**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post advises against self-harm and doesn't directly mention thoughts about killing themselves. It focuses on the negative aspects of self-harm rather than suicide. **Q2: N/A**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThe post doesn't directly discuss methods of suicide or self-harm in a planning context; it warns against self-harm. **Q3: N/A**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?

Severity: 5**\nThe post doesn't directly discuss planning or intending to kill themselves; it discusses past self-harm and advises against it. **Q5: N/A**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe author mentions self-harming in the past under psychosis, which is relevant. However, the context is about advising against self-harm rather than indicating current actions towards ending their life. **Q6: N/A**\n\nGiven the information and the context, the post does not directly answer any of the questions with a clear affirmation that would directly correlate to the severity scale questions. However, it implies a history of self-harm and discusses it in a manner that suggests it's related to suicide or, at the very least, to severe emotional or psychological distress.\n\nThe post's severity is not directly measurable by the scale provided due to its advisory nature against self-harm and lack of direct reference to current suicidal ideation or actions. However, it's worth noting that self-harm is sometimes associated with suicidal behaviors, though they are distinct.\n\nTherefore, based on the given metrics and the nature of the post:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The author mentions past self-harm, which indicates they have done something harmful to themselves in the past, but it's not directly about ending their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is assigned as 0 because, although the post is related to self-harm and implies a history of severe psychological distress, it doesn't directly indicate current suicidal ideation or plans as per the scale's criteria. The mention of past self-harm and advice against it doesn't directly fit into the severity scale without assuming current suicidal intent or ideation."

Im tired.\" This implies a strong sense of hopelessness and despair. Although they don't directly state wishing to be dead or go to sleep and not wake up, the sentiment conveys a similar feeling of being at the end of their rope. Thus, we can infer that they might be wishing they could escape their situation, which aligns with the spirit of Q1.\n\n- \"Q1\": The sentiment \"Im done. Im tired\" can be interpreted as a wish to escape their current situation, which might imply wishing they were dead or could go to sleep and not wake up.\n\n### Q2: Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\nThe user doesn't directly mention having thoughts about killing themselves, but their statement \"Im done. Im tired\" followed by the request to not be told they have \"so much to live for\" might suggest they are considering extreme measures or are deeply troubled.\n\n- \"Q2\": The user's statement could imply they are having severe distress, but there's no direct mention of thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n### Q3: Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\nThere's no explicit mention of thinking about how to kill themselves.\n\n- \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no direct or indirect indication of planning.\n\n### Q4: Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\nThe post doesn't clearly indicate an intention to act on any suicidal thoughts.\n\n- \"Q4\": N/A, since there's no clear indication of having suicidal thoughts or intentions.\n\n### Q5: Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\nThere's no indication that the user has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan.\n\n- \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no mention or implication of planning.\n\n### Q6: Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\nThe post doesn't indicate any action or preparation towards ending their life.\n\n- \"Q6\": N/A, since there's no indication of any action taken or preparation.\n\n### Severity\nGiven the user's expressions of hopelessness and despair (\"Im done. Im tired\"), and their background of significant emotional and familial challenges, the post suggests a level of distress that could be associated with wishing they were dead or could escape their situation. However, it doesn't directly indicate suicidal thoughts or actions.\n\n- The severity is thus more aligned with Q1 due to the expression of being \"done\" and \"tired\" of everything, indicating a strong wish to escape their current situation.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response based on the given template is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The sentiment 'Im done. Im tired' can be interpreted as a wish to escape their current situation.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user's statement could imply they are having severe distress, but there's no direct mention of thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation suggests that while the post indicates significant distress and a sense of hopelessness, it most closely aligns with the criteria for severity level 1, as it implies a wish to escape their situation without directly indicating suicidal thoughts or plans."

The post starts with \"Mental health check\" and expresses concern for others, indicating an awareness or concern about mental health issues.\n2. It asks how life has been lately and if the recipients have anyone to talk to, showing an interest in the well-being of others.\n3. It requests the recipients to rate their current feeling on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being fine and 10 meaning they can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the post based on the given metrics:\n\n- **Q1: Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?**  \nThe post does not directly or indirectly express a wish to be dead or to not wake up. It inquires about the recipient's state on a scale but doesn't directly relate to wishing to be dead. So, \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q2: Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**  \nThe post does not mention or imply thoughts about killing oneself. The scale mentioned is about feeling states from 1 to 10, not directly about suicidal thoughts. So, \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q3: Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**  \nThere's no mention or implication of thinking about methods to end one's life. So, \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q4: Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**  \nThe post doesn't indicate any intention of acting on suicidal thoughts. So, \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q5: Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**  \nThere's no evidence of planning or intending to carry out a suicidal act. So, \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q6: Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**  \nThe post doesn't suggest any action or preparation towards ending one's life. So, \"N/A\".\n\nGiven that the post is more about checking in on others' mental health and doesn't directly express or imply any suicidal ideation or behavior, the severity score should reflect that it's not directly related to expressing suicidal thoughts or actions.\n\nThus, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis post is not directly related to suicide; it's more of a supportive or checking-in post, hence a severity score of 0."

So, **\"Q4\": \"N/A\"**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\nThe post doesn't indicate any planning or intention to carry out a suicidal act. Thus, **\"Q5\": \"N/A\"**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThere's no indication in the post that the individual has taken or prepared to take any action to end their life. So, **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"**\n\nGiven the information and the criteria, the closest match is the first question due to the expression of feeling like being at the \"end of my life,\" which reflects a significant level of distress.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The sentiment implies a severe level of despair.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 1 because the post most closely aligns with the first criterion due to the expressed feelings of despair and hopelessness, even though it doesn't directly state wishing to be dead or not wake up."

Thus, we can't directly infer this from the post, so it's N/A.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post implies thoughts about killing oneself by mentioning slitting wrists, which is a method of suicide. Therefore, it indicates the presence of thoughts about killing oneself. So, \"Q2\": The post implies having thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post explicitly mentions a method (\"If i slit my wrists\") and asks about the consequence of such an action (\"how long would it take till i bleed out?\"), indicating thinking about how to do it. So, \"Q3\": The post directly asks about the details of a suicide method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The post doesn't directly state an intention to act, but asking about the specifics of a suicide method could imply some level of consideration or contemplation. However, it's not clear if there's a concrete intention. So, it's somewhat ambiguous, but we could argue it implies some level of intent or at least curiosity. Thus, \"Q4\": The post implies some level of consideration.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - The post shows that the individual is thinking about the details (\"how long would it take till i bleed out?\"), which indicates working out details. However, the intent to carry out the plan isn't explicitly stated. So, \"Q5\": The post indicates working out details.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - There's no indication in the post that the individual has taken any action towards ending their life. So, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the severity can be assessed based on the closest matching criteria. The post directly discusses a method of suicide and seeks information on its consequences, which aligns with having thoughts about how to kill oneself (Severity:3) and having worked out the details (Severity:5).\n\nThe response in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies having thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post directly asks about the details of a suicide method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies some level of consideration.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post indicates working out details.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the post indicates that the individual has started to work out or has worked out the details of how to kill themselves, even though there's no clear indication of having done anything or prepared to do anything to end their life.

However, there's no direct mention of wishing to be dead or not waking up. The sentiment is more about dissatisfaction with life circumstances than a wish to die. Thus, \"N/A\" for this specific phrasing, but it implies a negative outlook on life.\n\n### Q2: Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\nThe post does not directly express thoughts about killing oneself. It focuses on the difficulties faced due to autism, health issues, and feelings of inadequacy. So, \"N/A\".\n\n### Q3: Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\nThere's no indication in the post that the individual has considered methods of suicide. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n### Q4: Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\nSince there's no direct mention or implication of suicidal thoughts or intentions, \"N/A\".\n\n### Q5: Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\nThe post doesn't suggest that the individual has considered or planned suicide. So, \"N/A\".\n\n### Q6: Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\nThe post doesn't indicate any actions or preparations towards ending one's life. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n\n### Severity Evaluation\nWhile the post conveys a strong sense of dissatisfaction and frustration with life due to various challenges, it doesn't directly or indirectly suggest suicidal ideation or intent as per the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics. The closest we get is a sense of hopelessness or despair about the future and one's circumstances. However, the specific questions related to suicidal thoughts or actions are not directly answered by the content of the post.\n\n\nThe JSON response based on the analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 0 because, based on the provided metrics, the post does not directly relate to suicide or express suicidal ideation.

Severity:1**\n   The post contains the phrase \"I wish I was loved,\" which can be interpreted as a deep emotional pain or a wish for a different life situation, but it directly doesn't express a wish to be dead or to not wake up. However, the phrase \"I can\u2019t do it anymore\" suggests a level of despair. While it's not a direct \"wish to be dead,\" the sentiment expressed could be related to a broader context of hopelessness or a wish for relief, which might be slightly related to the first criterion. Thus, there is a stretch in directly applying this, but let's consider it as a potential \"1\" due to the overall tone of despair.\n\n   \"Q1\": The post expresses despair (\"I can\u2019t do it anymore\") and a wish for a different emotional state (\"I wish I was loved\"), which can imply a level of hopelessness or a wish for relief.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\n   The post does not directly mention or imply thoughts about killing oneself. The statement is more about emotional pain and the desire to be loved rather than expressing suicidal ideation.\n\n   \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   There's no indication in the post of any thoughts about methods of suicide.\n\n   \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\n   The post doesn't mention or imply any intention to act on suicidal thoughts.\n\n   \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\n   There's no mention or implication of planning or intending to carry out a suicidal act.\n\n   \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\n   The post does not indicate any action or preparation towards ending one's life.\n\n   \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven the analysis, the post is more related to emotional pain and a sense of hopelessness (\"I can\u2019t do it anymore\") and a desire for love (\"I wish I was loved\"). While it does not directly indicate suicidal ideation, the overall tone suggests a significant level of distress.\n\nThe closest applicable criterion is the first due to its overall tone of despair, but it's not a clear match.\n\nThus, the JSON response based on the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE would be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post expresses despair and a wish for a different emotional state, implying a level of hopelessness or a wish for relief.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis response assigns a severity level of 1, the lowest level of severity on the scale, due to the post's expression of despair and a wish that could be interpreted as a broad wish for relief or a different life circumstance, even though it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or not wake up."

Thus, \"N/A\" because it doesn't directly answer this question but implies a more severe intent.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post implies thoughts about killing oneself (\"pull the trigger\"), so it fulfills this criterion. \"The post implies a clear thought about killing oneself.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post directly references a method (\"pull the trigger\"), indicating thought about how to carry out the act. \"The user mentions a specific method (using a gun).\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The statement \"I feel like I could finally pull the trigger today\" suggests a sense of readiness or intention to act on these thoughts. \"The expression of feeling like they could pull the trigger implies intention.\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - While the post doesn't detail a worked-out plan beyond the method, the intention is implied. \"The user implies having a means (gun) but doesn't detail the plan.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post does not directly state that the user has done or started to do anything to end their life, but wishing for a gun could imply a step towards preparation. However, it's not conclusive. \"The user wishes for a gun, which could be seen as a preparatory step, but it's not a direct action.\"\n\nGiven the above analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies a clear thought about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user mentions a specific method (using a gun).\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The expression of feeling like they could pull the trigger implies intention.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The user implies having a means (gun) but doesn't detail the plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The user wishes for a gun, which could be seen as a preparatory step, but it's not a direct action.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning for assigning a severity of 6 is based on the implication that the user is contemplating a specific and lethal method (\"pull the trigger\") and expresses a readiness to do so (\"I feel like I could finally pull the trigger today\"). While the post doesn't directly state that the user has taken preparatory actions like obtaining a gun, the wish for one could be interpreted as a step towards preparation. The direct mention of a method and the expressed readiness to act on it aligns most closely with the criteria for severity level 6, as it indicates a potential for immediate risk."

Did you intend to carry out this plan?**  \n   The individual has taken actions that suggest they have started to work out the details (opening the window to jump out), and their preparation of a note further indicates planning. The intention is somewhat ambiguous due to their fear, but the actions suggest an intent.  \n   \"Q5\": \"The person has opened the window twice and prepared a note, indicating they have started to work out the details.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**  \n   The post clearly states that the person has \"already got the note prepared, and I've opened the window in my bedroom two times to try and jump out,\" which directly fulfills this criterion as they have done/prepared to do something to end their life.  \n   \"Q6\": \"The person has prepared a note and has attempted to jump out the window twice.\"\n\nGiven these observations, the severity should be rated based on the highest level of severity indicated by the responses.\n\nThe response to Q6 directly indicates that the person has done or prepared to do something to end their life, which corresponds to a severity of 6.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A but implied\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The person is feeling like committing, indicating suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The person has opened the window in their bedroom twice to try and jump out, indicating they have thought about the method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The person has a prepared note and has attempted to act on their thoughts by opening the window, indicating some intention.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The person has opened the window twice and prepared a note, indicating they have started to work out the details.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The person has prepared a note and has attempted to jump out the window twice.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```"

However, it implies a wish to end one's life, so one could infer a wish to not be alive. Thus, it implicitly fulfills this criterion, but it's more severe. **Q1: The post implies a stronger sentiment than just wishing to be dead.**\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The statement \"I feel like killing my self\" directly indicates having thoughts about killing oneself. **Q2: The post explicitly states having thoughts about killing oneself.**\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - There's no mention of how the individual might kill themselves. **Q3: N/A, as there's no indication of thinking about the method.**\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The statement \"I feel like killing my self\" suggests a strong emotional state but doesn't directly indicate an intention to act.

So, the post fulfills a more severe criteria, but directly answering this question: \"I'm so tired and exhausted, I can't\" implies a wish to not be alive or to escape the current state, so it can be related to this question. Thus, \"Q1\": \"The user is expressing exhaustion and a wish to end their life, implying a desire to not be alive.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The statement \"I'm planning on ending it all\" directly indicates thoughts about killing oneself.

Severity: 1**\nThe statement \"i hate myself\" could potentially imply a wish not to be alive or a state of severe self-dissatisfaction, but it does not directly indicate wishing to be dead or not wake up.

Severity:1**\nThe post does not directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. However, it does express a recurring and disturbing imagination about harming oneself (cutting wrists). Thus, the direct criteria for Severity:1 are not met, but there's an indication of harmful thoughts.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\nThe post mentions imagining cutting wrists, which implies having thoughts about a method that could potentially be lethal, though it's not directly stated as a wish to die. It indicates having thoughts that could be related to killing oneself.\n   - \"Q2\": The user imagines cutting their wrists, indicating thoughts that could be related to self-harm or suicide.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\nThe post specifies a method (cutting wrists), showing that the individual has thought about how they might harm themselves.\n   - \"Q3\": The user has imagined a specific method (cutting wrists), indicating they have thought about how to do it.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\nThere's no clear indication that the user intends to act on these thoughts. The post seems more perplexed by these recurring imaginations.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A, as there's no clear indication of intention to act.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\nThe post doesn't indicate that the user has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan beyond imagining cutting wrists.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no indication of working out details or intending to carry out a plan.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\nThere's no indication that the user has taken any action or prepared to end their life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as the user hasn't done or started to do anything to end their life.\n\nGiven these observations, the post indicates that the user has had thoughts related to self-harm (imagining cutting their wrists), which could be associated with Severity:2 (having thoughts about killing oneself), as it implies thinking about a potentially lethal method, even if not directly expressed as a wish to die.\n\nThe response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user imagines cutting their wrists, indicating thoughts that could be related to self-harm or suicide.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user has imagined a specific method (cutting wrists), indicating they have thought about how to do it.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 3\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 3 because the user has specified a method (cutting wrists) and has been thinking about it, which aligns with having thoughts about how they might do it, fitting the criteria for Severity:3. The absence of clear intent to act or further planning suggests that the severity, while significant, does not reach the higher levels."

Severity: 3**\n   - The inquiry about cyanide's price could imply thinking about methods of suicide, as cyanide is a known means.\n   - \"Q3\": The post implies potential thinking about a method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   - While there's an implication of potentially considering a method, there's no clear indication of having thoughts about suicide or the intention to act on them based solely on inquiring about cyanide's price.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

However, it's not directly equivalent to wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up. So, it's a bit related but not directly. \"Q1\": N/A (though it's a negative sentiment, it doesn't directly map to the question)\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" \nThe post starts with \"After 2 failed attempts the last 4 years\", which implies previous suicide attempts. This directly fulfills the criteria for having had thoughts about killing oneself in the past, and the mention of \"2 failed attempts\" strongly suggests so. \"Q2\": The user had previous thoughts and attempts.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" \nThere's no direct mention of thinking about how to kill themselves this time, but the fact that there were \"2 failed attempts\" implies previous thought or planning. However, the current context doesn't directly show thinking about the method. \"Q3\": N/A (though past attempts imply some level of planning, the current post doesn't directly indicate ongoing thoughts on the method)\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" \nThe post doesn't directly indicate current intention to act on suicidal thoughts. It mentions regret over vaping and health issues but doesn't directly link to current suicidal intent. \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

However, the current post doesn't directly indicate ongoing suicidal ideation or planning.\n\nThus, the severity is best reflected by the presence of past attempts and the user's current negative sentiment and health concerns.\n\nResponse in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user had previous thoughts and attempts.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\nThe severity is rated as 2 because the user has actually had thoughts about killing themselves, as evidenced by the \"2 failed attempts\" mentioned. While there's no indication of current intent or planning, the history of attempts is a significant factor. The scale doesn't directly account for past attempts without current ideation, so the rating reflects the closest relevant criterion."

Severity:1**\nThe post does not directly state that the individual wishes they were dead or wanted to sleep and not wake up. However, the context implies a struggle with finding reasons to live, which could be indirectly related. The explicit statement is about struggling to find reasons to live, not directly wishing to be dead. So, \"Q1\": N/A.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\nThe post doesn't directly indicate that the individual has had thoughts about killing themselves. It's about making a bucket list and finding reasons to live, suggesting a struggle but not explicitly mentioning suicidal thoughts. So, \"Q2\": N/A.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\nThere's no indication in the post that the individual has thought about how they might kill themselves. The focus is on reasons to live and a bucket list. So, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\nThe post doesn't suggest that the individual has had an intention to act on suicidal thoughts. It is focused on seeking reasons to live. So, \"Q4\": N/A.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\nThere's no mention or implication of working out details of a suicide plan. So, \"Q5\": N/A.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\nThe post is explicitly about not having given up and is seeking help or suggestions to counteract their current struggles, indicating no action towards ending their life. So, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nGiven the analysis, the post is more about struggling with the will to live and seeking positive reasons or activities (like a bucket list) to counteract that struggle, rather than expressing or indicating any direct suicidal ideation or intent.\n\nThus, the post's severity is best categorized as **1** because it implies a struggle that could be related to wishing to not be alive (though not directly stated), but it's more about the expression of a struggle to find reasons to live.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies struggling to find reasons to live, which could be seen as indirectly related to wishing to not be alive, but it's not a direct expression.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```"

While not directly fulfilling the criteria, the sentiment is somewhat related.\n\n   \"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish to be in a different situation but does not directly state a wish to be dead or not wake up.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?

Severity: 6**\nThere's no indication in the post that the author has taken any steps towards ending their life.\n\n   \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nThe overall sentiment of the post is one of deep despair and frustration due to health issues and financial difficulties. While it does not directly indicate suicidal thoughts or actions, the expression of hopelessness is significant.\n\nGiven the analysis, the severity is more aligned with a low score due to the lack of direct references to suicidal thoughts or actions. However, the expressed wish to be in a different situation and the overall tone of despair could relate to the first question.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish to be in a different situation but does not directly state a wish to be dead or not wake up.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation assigns a severity score of 1 because the post implies a deep sense of hopelessness and a wish to be in a different situation, which is somewhat related to the first question's criteria, but it does not directly fulfill it or meet the criteria for any higher severity questions."

The question itself implies that the person is having thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n\n3. By asking if they should kill themselves, it suggests they are thinking about how it could be done or considering it as an option.\n\n\n4. The fact that they are questioning whether they should kill themselves implies some level of intention or consideration of acting on these thoughts.\n\n\n5. There's no explicit mention of working out the details of how to kill themselves.\n\n\n6. There's also no explicit mention of having done, started to do, or prepared to do anything to end their life.\n\n\nLet's analyze the post against each metric:\n\n- \"Q1\": The post directly indicates suicidal ideation, more severe than just wishing to be dead. So, it fulfills a higher severity than 1. N/A\n- \"Q2\": The post implies having thoughts about killing oneself (\"Should i kill myself?\"). So, it fulfills this criteria.\n- \"Q3\": The post implies consideration of killing oneself as an option, suggesting some thought about the act. So, it fulfills this criteria.\n- \"Q4\": The person is questioning whether to act on these thoughts, indicating some level of intention. So, it fulfills this criteria.\n- \"Q5\": There's no explicit detail about working out the plan, but the question implies a level of consideration that could approach this. N/A directly, but it is related to the severity level.\n- \"Q6\": There's no explicit mention of having done anything to end their life.

The explicit request to not comment may also suggest a level of distress or contemplation. However, without explicit details on planning or acting, it aligns most closely with severity level 4."

So, \"Q1\": N/A.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\n   The post is asking about DNR orders in the context of unexpected medical emergencies like heart attacks or strokes, not about killing oneself.

Thus, \"Q5\": N/A.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\n   The question is about the possibility of having a DNR order, not about taking action to end one's life.

However, it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. So, while it's related to feelings of not belonging or being unhappy with one's existence, it doesn't directly fulfill the criteria. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post doesn't directly mention thoughts about killing oneself. It mentions not being fit for the world and a wish to remain in a certain age or state (\"Maybe I'll be 17 forever\"), which could be interpreted as a desire to escape the progression of life or its challenges but doesn't directly indicate suicidal thoughts. Hence, \"Q2\": N/A.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no mention or implication of considering methods for ending one's life.

Therefore, \"Q4\": N/A.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThe post doesn't suggest that the individual has worked out details of a suicide plan or intended to carry one out.

Severity: 6**\nThere's no indication in the post that the individual has taken, started, or prepared to take any action to end their life. Hence, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\n\nThe post expresses feelings of not belonging or being unhappy with one's existence and a somewhat escapist or dissatisfied sentiment (\"Maybe I'll be 17 forever\"), which might tangentially relate to the first question about wishing to not be alive or in the current state. However, it doesn't directly fulfill any of the criteria outlined in the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE.\n\n\nGiven the indirect nature of the post and its lack of direct reference to suicidal thoughts or actions, the severity is closer to 0 than to any higher number, but since it touches upon feelings of not being fit and a vague escapist sentiment, it might be slightly above 0.\n\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": N/A\n\"Q2\": N/A\n\"Q3\": N/A\n\"Q4\": N/A\n\"Q5\": N/A\n\"Q6\": N/A\n\"severity\": 1\n}\n\n\nHowever, a more accurate reflection based on the provided analysis would be:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"The sentiment could imply unhappiness with existence.\"\n\"Q2\": N/A\n\"Q3\": N/A\n\"Q4\": N/A\n\"Q5\": N/A\n\"Q6\": N/A\n\"severity\": 1\n}\n\n\nThis reflects a more nuanced understanding that while the post is not a clear indicator of suicidal ideation, it does convey some level of distress or dissatisfaction with life or one's circumstances."

The user states, \"I wish I could just have gotten to exist as a human being without this hell,\" which can be interpreted as wishing to not exist in the current form or circumstances, but it doesn't directly equate to wishing to be dead or go to sleep and not wake up. However, it implies a strong desire to escape their current situation or existence.\n\n   \"Q1\": The sentiment expresses a wish to not exist as they are, which is somewhat related but not directly equivalent to wishing to be dead.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post does not directly mention having thoughts about killing themselves. The language used is more about the emotional pain and frustration of being treated poorly because of their gender.\n\n   \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no indication in the post that the user has been thinking about methods of suicide.\n\n   \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe post does not directly indicate that the user has had thoughts of suicide or any intention to act on such thoughts.\n\n   \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The closest relevant statement is the wish to not exist as they are (\"I wish I could just have gotten to exist as a human being without this hell\"), which might be seen as related to Q1. However, it's more about the wish to escape their circumstances rather than a direct wish to be dead.\n\nGiven this, the severity is not directly aligned with the higher levels of the scale. The post indicates significant emotional distress but does not explicitly mention suicidal ideation or behaviors.\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"The sentiment expresses a wish to not exist as they are, which is somewhat related but not directly equivalent to wishing to be dead.\"\n\"Q2\": \"N/A\"\n\"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\"Q4\": \"N/A\"\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\"severity\": 1\n}\n\nThe reasoning behind assigning a severity of 1 is based on the closest match being the expression of a wish to not exist in their current form, which is somewhat analogous to the sentiment captured by Q1, albeit not a perfect match."

It refers to those who have survived, implying a discussion about individuals who have attempted suicide but lived. Thus, it doesn't directly fulfill this criterion.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** Severity: 2\n   - The post doesn't explicitly mention having thoughts about killing oneself.

It implies a past attempt but focuses on the regret aspect.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven the content of the post, it is about individuals who have survived a suicide attempt and their feelings of regret about not leaving a letter. While it is related to suicide in the context that it discusses survivors of suicide attempts, it doesn't directly indicate current suicidal ideation or intent as per the scale.\n\nThe post's discussion about regret and survivors indicates a context related to suicide but does not fit directly into any of the severity questions as it doesn't express current suicidal thoughts or actions.\n\nThus, the response in JSON format, based on the template, is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe \"severity\" is rated as 0 because, although the post is related to suicide, it doesn't directly fulfill any of the criteria listed in the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. The scale is designed to assess the severity of suicidal ideation and behavior, and the post is more about the reflection or regret after a suicide attempt rather than indicating current suicidal ideation or intent."

Thus, \"Q1\": The user has expressed a form of wishing they were not alive.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe user explicitly states, \"I thought about it how I would do it at least once or twice a day,\" indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves. Thus, \"Q2\": The user has had thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThe user mentions, \"I thought about it how I would do it,\" and specifies, \"I would do it with a shotgun.\" This shows they have thought about the method. Thus, \"Q3\": The user has thought about the method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe user indicates a conditional intent based on their perceived future circumstances (\"I don't see myself living past 25 years old\") but is held back by the potential impact on their mom. However, thinking about it \"at least once or twice a day\" suggests a recurring consideration that aligns with having some intention.

Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThe user has a specific method in mind (\"I would do it with a shotgun\") but does not indicate they have taken steps to acquire the means. The intent is conditional and restrained by the consideration of their mom's feelings.

So, \"Q1\": N/A\n\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The post implies a potential risk by mentioning having drugs and asking about taking them all together, which could be interpreted as having thoughts about ending one's life, albeit indirectly. So, \"Q2\": The inquiry about the effects of taking all the drugs together could imply having thoughts about self-harm or suicide.\n\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The post shows consideration of a specific method (taking all the drugs together) and asks about the outcome, indicating thinking about how to end one's life. So, \"Q3\": The question directly pertains to considering a method.\n\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - While there's an inquiry about the consequences of taking all the drugs, it doesn't directly state an intention to act on these thoughts. However, the fact that they're asking about the outcome of taking all the drugs suggests some level of contemplation. So, \"Q4\": N/A directly, but it's a borderline case because asking about the effect of taking all the drugs could imply some consideration of acting.\n\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - The post doesn't explicitly state working out the details or intending to carry out the plan, but it does show an interest in the outcome of a specific action (taking all the drugs). So, \"Q5\": N/A, but it hints at it.\n\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post doesn't indicate that the person has taken any action or started preparing to end their life; it's a question about the potential outcome. So, \"Q6\": N/A\n\n\nGiven the above analysis, the closest matching criteria that directly relate to the post's content are Q2 and Q3, as they involve having thoughts about killing oneself and thinking about how to do it, respectively.\n\n\nThe severity can be rated based on the closest matching criteria. The post indirectly suggests having thoughts about suicide (Severity: 2) and thinking about how to do it (Severity: 3). The most severe directly related criteria is Q3.\n\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q2\": \"The inquiry implies having thoughts about self-harm or suicide.\",\n\"Q3\": \"The question directly pertains to considering a method.\",\n\"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 3\n}"

Severity: 2**\nThe poem expresses a deep emotional pain and a sense of being trapped (\"I cry out trapped in an endless web\"), with a yearning for peace and a need for release (\"Yearning for peace. / I must find my release\"). While these expressions convey a strong desire to end the suffering, they do not directly indicate thoughts about killing oneself. The language is more suggestive of a need for emotional or psychological release rather than a specific act like suicide.\n\n   \"Q2\": \"The post implies a strong desire to end suffering but doesn't directly indicate thoughts about killing oneself; the language suggests a need for emotional or psychological release.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?

Thus, the criteria for Q3 are fulfilled.\n\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The post states, \"My next attempt will be with antifreeze\" and \"I really want my life to end,\" demonstrating both the thought and the intention to act on it. Thus, the criteria for Q4 are fulfilled.\n\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - While the individual specifies a planned method (antifreeze), there's no explicit mention of working out the details. However, they have shown a clear intention to carry out the plan by stating it's their \"next attempt.\" Thus, the criteria for having an intention are fulfilled, but the detail about working out the plan is somewhat implicit. Thus, the criteria for Q5 are somewhat fulfilled.\n\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post reveals a past attempt (\"I tried to cut my carotid artery\") and a future plan (\"My next attempt will be with antifreeze\"), indicating they have done something and are planning to do something to end their life. Thus, the criteria for Q6 are fulfilled.\n\n\nGiven the analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"The individual expresses a strong wish to be dead.\",\n\"Q2\": \"The post clearly indicates thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n\"Q3\": \"The individual has thought about methods to kill themselves.\",\n\"Q4\": \"The post demonstrates both the thought and the intention to act on it.\",\n\"Q5\": \"The individual has a clear intention to carry out the plan, though the details are not extensively outlined.\",\n\"Q6\": \"The post reveals both a past attempt and a future plan to end their life.\",\n\"severity\": 6\n}"

Im so done with this.\" While it doesn't directly say \"I wish I were dead,\" the sentiment of being extremely hopeless and done with life could imply a wish to escape their current state, potentially aligning with wishing to not be alive or to not wake up.

Thus, it's not a clear \"yes\" but indicates distress. **\"Q1\": N/A (though there's an implication of wanting to escape, it doesn't directly fulfill the criteria)**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The post mentions \"taking all of my medication at once,\" which is a method of suicide. This indicates having thoughts about killing oneself. **\"Q2\": The post mentions taking all medication at once, indicating suicidal thoughts.**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   The post specifies \"taking all of my medication at once\" as a thought, indicating they have been thinking about how to do it. **\"Q3\": The post explicitly mentions a method (taking all medication at once).**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   The post expresses uncertainty (\"I'm not sure if I\u2019m actually suicidal\") but mentions having intrusive thoughts about harmful actions. The intention is not clearly stated, but the presence of intrusive thoughts about specific harmful actions suggests some level of consideration. **\"Q4\": The thoughts are intrusive and specific, suggesting some level of consideration of acting on them.**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   The post does not explicitly state that they have worked out the details or intended to carry out the plan, but mentions specific actions like \"taking all of my medication at once.\" There's no clear indication of having started to work out the details beyond this thought. **\"Q5\": N/A (though a method is mentioned, there's no clear indication of working out the details or intending to carry out the plan).**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   There's no mention of having done, started, or prepared to do anything to end their life. The thoughts are described as \"intrusive,\" but there's no indication of action or preparation towards suicide. **\"Q6\": N/A (no indication of having taken any steps towards ending their life).**\n\nGiven these observations, the post directly fulfills criteria for Q2 and Q3. The presence of thoughts about a specific method indicates a higher severity level than just wishing to be dead or having nonspecific thoughts about suicide.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post mentions taking all medication at once, indicating suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post explicitly mentions a method (taking all medication at once).\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The thoughts are intrusive and specific, suggesting some level of consideration of acting on them.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 3\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 3 because the post directly indicates having thoughts about killing oneself and thinking about how to do it (through taking all medication at once), but there's no clear indication of intention to act on these thoughts, working out the details, or preparing to end their life."

Severity:1**\n   - The post implies an action (taking pills) that could be associated with a wish to harm oneself, but it doesn't directly state wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up. So, the direct answer isn't available, but there's an implication of potential self-harm. \n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\n   - The user mentions taking pills, which could be seen as a potential method for suicide, but the context seems more related to concern about the effect of the overdose rather than an explicit statement of wanting to kill themselves.\n   - \"Q2\": N/A, but the action taken (OD on paracetamol) suggests some level of self-harm consideration.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   - The user has taken an action (taking 5 pills) that shows they have considered or acted upon a potential method, but the primary concern seems to be about the potential effect given their health condition rather than stating they were thinking about killing themselves.\n   - \"Q3\": The action of taking pills could imply some thought about the method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\n   - The user took 5 pills, indicating an action was taken, but the post doesn't clearly state the intention was to end their life. The concern about potential harm due to kidney problems suggests a realization of potential consequences, not necessarily an intention to die.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A, as the primary intention isn't clearly suicide.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\n   - The post doesn't indicate detailed planning for suicide; the focus is on the immediate action taken and its potential consequences.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\n   - The user took 5 paracetamol pills, which is an action. However, the context doesn't strongly suggest it was done with the clear intention of ending their life, rather seeking to understand the potential consequences.\n   - \"Q6\": The user did something (took pills) that could potentially harm them, showing some level of action.\n\nGiven the analysis, the user has taken an action that could be harmful (taking 5 paracetamol pills), and they have concerns about the potential effects due to their health condition. However, the explicit intention behind this action isn't clearly stated as being to end their life.\n\nThus, the severity rating, based on the closest matching criteria and the available information, is best represented as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": The action of taking pills could imply some thought about the method,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": The user did something (took pills) that could potentially harm them,\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nHowever, a more nuanced interpretation considering the context provided might argue the severity should be lower due to the lack of clear suicidal intent. The user seems more concerned about the potential outcome of their action rather than explicitly stating a desire to end their life. Yet, based strictly on the scale and the fact that an action was taken, the response leans towards a higher severity due to the action having been taken.\n\nUpon reconsideration and strict adherence to the scale, the closest match for the action described (taking pills, which is a harmful action) aligns more closely with a severity of 6 due to the action taken, even though the intent is not clearly to end their life.\n\nTherefore, maintaining the response format as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": The action of taking pills could imply some thought about the method,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": The user did something (took pills) that could potentially harm them,\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```"

However, the overall sentiment is very negative, focusing on the lack of friendships, being held back in school, and poor social skills. There's a sense of hopelessness. **Q1: N/A** because it's not directly stated, but there's an underlying tone of despair.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post does not directly mention thoughts about killing oneself. It talks about the difficulties faced and the lack of friendships but doesn't explicitly mention suicidal thoughts. **Q2: N/A**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no mention or implication of thinking about how to kill oneself. **Q3: N/A**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe post doesn't indicate any intention of acting on suicidal thoughts. **Q4: N/A**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The sentiment is negative and despairing, focusing on the lack of friendships and personal perceived shortcomings.\n\nHowever, the severity can still be considered based on the overall tone and content. While there's no direct expression of suicidal ideation, the post conveys a strong sense of isolation and hopelessness, which can be a risk factor.\n\nThus, the response in JSON format is:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\nThe severity is rated as 1 because, while the post doesn't directly state a wish to be dead, it conveys a sense of hopelessness and despair that could be associated with the first level of the scale (\"wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up\"). The overall tone is more aligned with feelings of worthlessness and isolation rather than explicit suicidal ideation. However, it's on the boundary and warrants careful consideration. \n\nIn a real-world scenario, a response to such a post should involve reaching out and offering support, rather than solely relying on a severity score."

Severity: 1**\nThe post does not directly express a wish to be dead or to go to sleep and not wake up. However, it implies distress and a desire for an external intervention or solution (\"If anyone could listen to what s happening in my life and tell me the options\"). So, the direct criteria for Severity: 1 are not met, but there's an underlying sense of desperation.\n\n   \"Q1\": N/A\n\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post does not explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself.

Severity: 3**\nThere's no indication in the post that the individual has thought about methods of suicide.\n\n   \"Q3\": N/A\n\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post doesn't directly suggest that the individual has had thoughts of suicide or any intention to act on them.

Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication that the individual has started to work out or has worked out details of a suicide plan.\n\n   \"Q5\": N/A\n\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not suggest that any action has been taken towards ending their life. Instead, it suggests a desire to talk before \"anything happens,\" which could be interpreted as a preventive measure.\n\n   \"Q6\": N/A\n\n\nThe post implies a state of distress and a desire for someone to talk to or for options to be presented, indicated by \"If anyone could listen to what s happening in my life and tell me the options. I would gladly talk to them before anything happens.\" While it doesn't directly fulfill any of the criteria for severity levels 1 through 6, it suggests a level of distress that could potentially be associated with lower levels of the scale if interpreted very loosely.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided and sticking closely to the criteria, the post does not directly indicate any suicidal ideation or intent. Thus, it should be rated based on the closest interpretation.\n\n\nGiven the underlying distress and implicit desire for external intervention or solution without directly expressing suicidal thoughts or intentions, but still indicating a cry for help:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": N/A,\n\"Q2\": N/A,\n\"Q3\": N/A,\n\"Q4\": N/A,\n\"Q5\": N/A,\n\"Q6\": N/A,\n\"severity\": 1\n}\n\n\nThe reasoning for assigning a severity of 1 is that while the post doesn't directly state a wish to be dead, it implies a significant level of distress and a desire to avoid \"anything happens,\" which can be very loosely associated with the first question's criteria about wishing to be dead or not wake up, though it's a bit of a stretch. The post is more about seeking help and discussing options rather than expressing a clear wish to be dead. However, given the available choices and the context, it seems to be the closest response that acknowledges the distress without clear suicidal ideation. A more accurate interpretation might be that the severity is 0 if we strictly follow the criteria and the absence of direct suicidal ideation or intent. \n\n\nTherefore, upon a stricter interpretation:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": N/A,\n\"Q2\": N/A,\n\"Q3\": N/A,\n\"Q4\": N/A,\n\"Q5\": N/A,\n\"Q6\": N/A,\n\"severity\": 0\n}"

Severity: 1**\n   - The post does not directly express a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. It discusses a method related to suicide (using helium) but does not explicitly state a wish to die. Therefore, **Q1: N/A**.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\n   - The post implies thoughts about killing oneself by mentioning a specific method (helium suicide). This indicates that the person has had thoughts about suicide. Thus, **Q2: The post implies thoughts of killing oneself**.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   - The post directly asks about the specifics of using helium for suicide, including the type of helium tank needed and other considerations. This shows that the person is thinking about how to carry out the act. So, **Q3: The post directly indicates thinking about the method**.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   - The detailed inquiry about the logistics of using helium for suicide suggests that the person is considering acting on these thoughts. Therefore, **Q4: The post implies intention to act on these thoughts**.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\n   - The post demonstrates an effort to work out the details by asking about the type of helium tank and other necessary considerations. This indicates a step towards planning. Hence, **Q5: The post indicates working out the details**.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\n   - There's no direct evidence in the post that the person has taken action or prepared to end their life. The inquiry is about what is needed, not a statement of having done or started doing it. So, **Q6: N/A**.\n\nGiven this analysis, the post is related to suicide and indicates a level of planning and consideration. The highest severity level directly supported by the content is **5**, as it shows the person is working out the details of their plan.\n\nHere's the response in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies thoughts of killing oneself\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post directly indicates thinking about the method\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies intention to act on these thoughts\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post indicates working out the details\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```"

Severity: 1**\nThe post expresses self-hatred and dissatisfaction with one's current state (\"i hate who i am\"), which could potentially imply a wish not to be alive or be in a different state. However, it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or sleep and not wake up. Thus, while there's a negative sentiment, it doesn't directly fulfill this criterion. **\"Q1\": N/A**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post doesn't explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself. It focuses on self-hatred and feeling like one is \"ruining everything,\" which indicates distress but not directly suicidal thoughts. **\"Q2\": N/A**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no mention or implication of thinking about methods to end one's life. **\"Q3\": N/A**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?

However, it's worth noting that such expressions of self-hatred and feeling like one is \"ruining everything\" can be concerning and may warrant support or intervention for underlying issues."

Severity: 1**\n   - The post implies a deep distress and inability to cope with the potential return to their home country, suggesting a wish to escape their current predicament. However, it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. The statement \"I just cannot live back in my home country\" implies a strong desire to avoid a certain reality, but it doesn't directly map to wishing to be dead. Thus, this could be considered as indirectly related, but not a clear \"yes.\" So, \"Q1\": N/A but leaning towards a possible interpretation under stress.\n\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\n   - The post directly mentions \"Is suicide justified in this case?\" which indicates that the person has indeed had thoughts about suicide, as they are questioning its justification. Thus, \"Q2\": The post directly indicates thoughts about killing oneself by mentioning suicide.\n\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   - There's no information in the post about how the person might commit suicide. The question is about the justification of suicide, not the method. So, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   - The post does not explicitly indicate an intention to act on the thoughts of suicide. It asks if suicide is justified, which could be interpreted as seeking validation or exploring the idea rather than a direct intention to act. So, \"Q4\": N/A.\n\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\n   - As established, there's no mention of working out details or planning.

Severity: 6**\n   - There's no indication that the person has taken any steps towards ending their life. So, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The post does not directly state a wish to be dead (Q1), but it does indicate thoughts about suicide (Q2).\n- There's no evidence of planning or intending to act on these thoughts (Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6).\n\nThus, the severity based on the provided metrics is at least a 2 because the person has had thoughts about killing themselves.\n\nThe JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post directly indicates thoughts about killing oneself by mentioning suicide.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation categorizes the post with a severity of 2, as it directly indicates the person has had thoughts about killing themselves but does not provide evidence of further planning or action."

Severity:2**\n   The post does not explicitly mention thoughts of killing oneself. The language used is about seeking someone to talk to because they are doing badly, without specifying the nature of their distress.\n   - \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   There's no indication in the post that the person has considered methods of suicide.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?

Severity:6**\n   The post does not suggest that the person has taken any steps towards ending their life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A\n\nThe post indicates that the person is experiencing significant distress (\"doing really really badly\") and is seeking someone to talk to. While it doesn't directly fulfill any of the criteria for severity levels 1 through 6, it implies a state of distress that could potentially be related to suicidal thoughts or feelings, even though not explicitly stated.\n\nGiven the information and the context provided:\n- The person is in distress.\n- There's an implicit request for support.\n\nThus, while the post doesn't directly meet the criteria for any of the severity levels, the fact that the person is \"doing really really badly\" and is seeking someone to talk to could be interpreted as an indirect indicator of potential suicidal ideation or a cry for help.\n\nTherefore, a cautious interpretation might lean towards a low severity score due to the absence of explicit statements about suicidal thoughts or intentions. However, the severity scale is based on specific questions, and the post doesn't directly answer any of them affirmatively.\n\nThe response in JSON format, based on the above analysis, is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning behind assigning a \"severity\" of 1 is that while the post does not directly state any suicidal ideation or intent, it conveys a significant level of distress and a request for support, which aligns somewhat with the spirit of the first question (wishing to be dead or to sleep and not wake up) in terms of implying the person is not okay. However, it's a stretch, and ideally, the score should reflect that the post doesn't directly indicate suicidality. A more conservative interpretation might argue for a \"severity\" of 0 due to the lack of direct evidence. Nonetheless, given the context of distress and the request for someone to talk to, a cautious interpretation leans towards a minimal acknowledgment of potential underlying issues.\n\nIn a more appropriate interpretation directly following the scale and instructions:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that the post, while indicative of distress, does not directly indicate suicidality or fulfill any of the specific criteria outlined in the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE."

However, it does not directly fulfill the criteria for Severity: 3, 5, or 6 as it doesn't discuss methods, planning, or preparation/actions to end life.\n\nThe highest severity level directly supported is Severity: 4 due to the implied conditional intention to act on their thoughts if circumstances don't improve.\n\nThe JSON response based on the provided template is:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a wish not to be alive by the end of December and states they have nothing to live for.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user has thoughts about being dead by the end of December.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user has thoughts and a conditional intention based on future events.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

The statement \"I don\u2019t see a reason to keep going\" is the most concerning and aligns with having thoughts about killing oneself or at least a significant level of despair that could be associated with suicidal ideation (Severity: 2).\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": \"I don\u2019t see a reason to keep going implies potential suicidal ideation\",\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation suggests that while the post is concerning and indicates significant distress, it does not directly indicate a specific plan or action towards suicide. Therefore, it is rated at a severity level of 2, as it implies having thoughts about killing oneself or a significant level of despair."

Severity:1**\n   - The post does not directly indicate that the person has wished they were dead or wished to go to sleep and not wake up. It is a plea for someone to talk to them, which can be interpreted as a call for help or support but does not directly relate to wishing to be dead. Thus, \"N/A\".\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\n   - The post does not explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself. It is a request for someone to talk, indicating a need for support or conversation. Therefore, \"N/A\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   - There's no indication in the post that the person has been thinking about how to kill themselves. The focus is on seeking someone to talk to. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\n   - The post does not mention having thoughts about suicide or any intention to act on such thoughts. It's a plea for conversation. So, \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\n   - The post doesn't imply that the person has started to work out or has worked out details of suicide. It's about seeking someone to talk to. Thus, \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\n   - There's no indication that the person has taken any steps towards ending their life. The post is a request for conversation. Therefore, \"N/A\".\n\nThe overall severity is not directly related to the scale's higher numbers since the post doesn't explicitly mention suicidal thoughts or actions. However, the plea \"help can someone just talk to me? please\" can be seen as a cry for help, which might imply the person is struggling. While it's not a direct indication of suicidal ideation, it suggests distress.\n\nGiven the information and the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE, the most appropriate response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning for assigning a severity of 1 is that while the post does not directly fulfill the criteria for any of the specific questions related to suicidal ideation or behavior, it does indicate some level of distress (\"help\") and a desire for human connection (\"can someone just talk to me?\"), which can be considered a mild indicator of potential underlying issues. However, it's worth noting that a more conservative interpretation based strictly on the provided criteria might argue for a severity of 0 if one interprets the post as not being directly related to suicide or suicidal ideation.\n\nTherefore, a more conservative interpretation could result in:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis reflects that the post is more about seeking support than directly expressing suicidal thoughts or behaviors."

The mention of being \"about to get engulfed by flames\" and having a \"lighter in hand and a full gas canister by my side\" demonstrates this. So, \"Yes\" or the reasoning fulfills this criterion, but it's more severe. Hence, \"N/A\" as it directly moves to a more severe category.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**  \n   The post explicitly mentions having a lighter and a gas canister and intending to use them to end their life, indicating a clear plan. Thus, \"Yes\" or the reasoning fulfills this criterion.

The statement \"I'm not going to cause a wildfire\u2014there\u2019s nothing flammable around me except myself\" further indicates planning. The intent to carry out the plan is clear from \"This is the end\" and \"By the time you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019ll be gone.\" Thus, \"Yes\" or the reasoning fulfills this criterion. Hence, \"The post shows that details have been worked out and there is an intent to carry out the plan.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**  \n   The post implies that the person is on the verge of taking action (\"About to get engulfed by flames\"), indicating preparation and the act of ending their life is imminent.

Severity: 1**\nThe post implies a sense of acceptance or resignation towards dying soon, which could be interpreted as wishing to not be alive or at least not being opposed to the idea of dying. The statement \"Im going to die soon\" followed by \"im real tired\" suggests a potential wish or acceptance of death, aligning with the sentiment of being tired of living. Thus, **Q1: The post implies a sense of acceptance or resignation towards dying.**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post directly states \"Im going to die soon,\" which could be interpreted as having thoughts about one's own death. However, it doesn't directly imply an active thought about killing oneself; it's more about an acceptance or statement of an impending event. Thus, **Q2: N/A** because the post doesn't explicitly mention having thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThe post mentions \"im hope itll be easy,\" which could imply some thought about the manner of death. However, it's not explicit about planning or thinking about how to kill oneself.

Severity: 4**\nThe statement \"Im going to die soon\" followed by \"im hope itll be easy\" could suggest some level of intention or at least a passive acceptance towards one's death. However, there's no clear indication of an active intention to act on these thoughts. Thus, **Q4: N/A** because it doesn't clearly show an intention to act.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?

Severity: 6**\nThe post doesn't indicate any action taken or preparation to end one's life. Thus, **Q6: N/A**.\n\nGiven the information and the implications in the post, the most relevant criteria that are met directly relate to wishing to be dead or not wake up (though not directly stated, the sentiment is there) and somewhat thinking about how death might occur (implied by hoping it will be easy). The closest matching severity level directly related to the expressed sentiment is **Severity: 3** due to the implication of thinking about the nature of one's death (\"im hope itll be easy\").\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a sense of acceptance or resignation towards dying.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The mention of hoping it will be easy could imply some thought about the method or nature of death.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 3\n}\n```"

Thus, \"Q2\": The user has had thoughts about killing himself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   The user mentions specific methods (stabbing with a knife or injecting with cleaner) and that these thoughts are \"a little more planned out,\" indicating they have been thinking about how to do it.

Thus, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nGiven the analysis, the user's post indicates they have had thoughts about killing themselves (Q2 fulfilled), have considered methods (Q3 fulfilled), and have some intention of acting on these thoughts (Q4 fulfilled).

However, it mentions being \"pretty depressed\" and having Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), indicating some level of distress. The primary concern is for the boyfriend, not themselves in this context. So, \"N/A\" for this specific context but the underlying condition is mentioned.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - There's no explicit mention of having thoughts about killing themselves.

So, the reasoning could be related but not directly answering this question. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** - The post mentions thinking about suicide \"all the time every day every night,\" which directly implies having thoughts about killing themselves. Therefore, \"Q2\": The user explicitly mentions having thoughts about suicide.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** - The post doesn't specify thinking about the method of suicide; it only mentions thinking about suicide. Hence, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** - The post does not explicitly state an intention to act on these thoughts, though the preoccupation is evident. So, \"Q4\": N/A.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"** - There's no indication in the post that the user has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan. Thus, \"Q5\": N/A.\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"** - The post does not indicate that the user has taken any action or prepared to end their life. So, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nGiven these observations, the most relevant information is that the user is having persistent thoughts about suicide (\"thinking about suicide 24/7\"), which aligns with **Q2**.\n\nThe JSON response based on the analysis is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": The user explicitly mentions having thoughts about suicide,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThe assigned severity is 2 because the post directly indicates having thoughts about killing oneself, which matches the criteria for Severity: 2. The preoccupation with suicide (\"thinking about it all the time\") indicates a significant level of distress, but there's no indication of planning or acting on these thoughts as per the higher severity criteria."

However, the post does not directly indicate suicidal ideation or intent according to the given scale.\n\n\nGiven the information and the fact that the post implies the person is not doing well and is seeking to talk to someone, it suggests some level of distress. However, without explicit statements related to suicidal thoughts or intentions, we must be cautious in our interpretation.\n\n\nWhile the post doesn't directly answer any of the questions with a clear affirmative based on the provided text, the expression of not doing well and seeking someone to talk to could be interpreted as a cry for help or an indication of being in a difficult emotional state.\n\n\nHowever, based strictly on the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics and the information given, the severity should be evaluated based on the direct indicators of suicidal thoughts or actions, which are not present here.\n\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format, based on the provided template and the analysis above, is:\n\n\n```\n{\n\"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\n\nThe severity is rated as 0 because the post does not directly relate to suicide according to the given criteria, even though it implies the person is experiencing some distress.

Thus, \"Q2\": The statement \"I'm done\" and the mention of getting a gun could imply thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?** The post explicitly mentions a plan to \"get a gun before the year ends,\" which indicates thinking about a method. Thus, \"Q3\": The post mentions a specific plan to obtain a gun.\n\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?** The post indicates an intention to act on the plan (\"From now on, I think I'm going to stick with my plan to get a gun\"), suggesting an intention to follow through. Thus, \"Q4\": The statement about sticking with the plan to get a gun implies intention.\n\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?** While the post indicates a plan to obtain a gun, it doesn't detail the steps taken or to be taken towards killing oneself, just the intention to get a gun. Thus, \"Q5\": N/A, because it doesn't specify working out the details of suicide.\n\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?** The post doesn't indicate that any action has been taken (\"I'm going to stick with my plan\") towards obtaining a gun or ending life, but it does express a clear intention to do so. Thus, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q2\": \"The statement 'I'm done' and the mention of getting a gun could imply thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n\"Q3\": \"The post mentions a specific plan to obtain a gun.\",\n\"Q4\": \"The statement about sticking with the plan to get a gun implies intention.\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 4\n}\n\n\nThe severity is rated as 4 because the post indicates having thoughts about killing oneself and having some intention of acting on them by planning to obtain a gun, but it doesn't clearly state that they have started working out the details or have taken any action towards ending their life."

Severity:2**\n   - There's no indication in the post of thoughts about killing oneself. The post is asking about buying pure Nitrogen, which could be for various purposes, not necessarily related to self-harm. Thus, N/A.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   - The post could be interpreted as seeking information on how to obtain a specific substance, but there's no clear indication that it's related to suicide or self-harm. Nitrogen is used in various industrial and scientific applications. Hence, N/A.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?

Severity:5**\n   - The post is about buying pure Nitrogen, and there's no clear connection to working out details of suicide. While it's worth noting that Nitrogen can be used in certain methods of suicide (such as inert gas asphyxiation), the context of the question doesn't directly imply an intention to use it for that purpose. However, this raises some concern, but without more context, it's still N/A.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\n   - There's no indication that the person has done or started to do anything to end their life. The question is about seeking information, not stating an action taken or planned towards self-harm. So, N/A.\n\nHowever, considering the potential misuse of Nitrogen for suicide by inert gas asphyxiation, a nuanced view might recognize some level of concern, especially if one is aware of the potential uses of Nitrogen in this context. Yet, based strictly on the information given and the context that it is a query about purchasing a chemical substance (which has various legitimate uses), the severity should be evaluated based on direct indicators of suicidal ideation or behavior.\n\nGiven the information and sticking strictly to the provided template and the nature of the post, the response should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation is based on the fact that the post, as presented, does not directly indicate or imply suicidal ideation or behavior according to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics. The post is a question about purchasing a substance that has various uses, and without additional context suggesting otherwise, it is treated as not related to suicide."

However, the overall tone could imply a negative emotional state.\n\n   \"Q1\": The post implies a negative emotional state but doesn't directly state wishing to be dead or not waking up.

The user expresses having lost everything important, including their girlfriend, and implies guilt (\"it's all my fault\"). The emotional distress is evident, and the phrase \"goodbye\" at the beginning and end can be seen as a wish to disconnect or escape their current state, potentially indicating a wish to not be alive or to escape their pain. Thus, **Q1: The emotional state and the use of \"goodbye\" may imply a wish to be dead or not wake up.**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post does not directly mention thoughts of killing themselves, but the context suggests significant emotional pain. The user is clearly distraught and mentions losing everything important. However, there's no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts. Thus, **Q2: N/A**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no indication in the post that the user has considered methods of suicide.

Thus, **Q6: N/A**\n\nGiven the analysis, the most relevant question that is somewhat fulfilled is Q1 due to the expression of extreme emotional distress and the implication of wanting to escape their pain.\n\nHere's the response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The emotional state and the use of 'goodbye' may imply a wish to be dead or not wake up.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 1 because the post implies a potential wish to be dead or not wake up due to the emotional distress and language used, but it does not explicitly indicate suicidal thoughts or actions beyond that."

Severity: 2**\n   There's no direct or indirect indication in the post that the person has had thoughts about killing themselves.

The closest matching criterion is Q2 because it implies having thoughts that could be related to killing oneself.\n\nThus, the severity is determined to be 2 because the post implies having thoughts about a drastic action (\"I could just do it\") without clearly stating or detailing any plan or intention.\n\nHere is the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The phrase 'I could just do it' implies having thoughts that could be related to killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

Severity: 1**\nThe post states, \"I wish I could just disappear\" which doesn't directly imply wishing to be dead or not waking up. However, the sentiment of wanting to \"disappear\" can be interpreted as a strong desire to escape one's current situation or emotional pain, which is somewhat related. But it doesn't directly match the criteria of wishing to be dead or not wake up. So, \"N/A\" for a direct match, but it implies a strong desire to escape.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post says, \"I couldn't ever try again,\" which could be interpreted as not being able to attempt suicide again or possibly not being able to try anything else in life. The phrase doesn't directly indicate having thoughts about killing oneself, but it's a negative statement that could be related to suicidal ideation. However, it's more about not being able to make another attempt rather than having thoughts about it. So, it's somewhat related but not a clear indication, thus \"N/A\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no direct mention or implication of thinking about the method to end one's life. Therefore, \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post does not directly indicate having thoughts of suicide or the intention to act on them. The phrase \"I couldn't ever try again\" is ambiguous and doesn't clearly suggest an intention to act on suicidal thoughts. So, \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication of working out details of a suicide plan in the post. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not indicate any action or preparation to end one's life. So, \"N/A\".\n\nThe post expresses a strong desire to escape from emotional pain (\"a break from my brain that hates me so much\"), which is a significant distress signal. While it doesn't directly answer any of the questions with a clear affirmative, the overall sentiment is one of intense emotional suffering and a wish to \"disappear,\" which is closest to the sentiment in Q1, though not directly equivalent.\n\nGiven the information and the closest match:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The wish to 'disappear' is a strong desire to escape, somewhat related to wishing to not be present, though not directly equivalent to wishing to be dead or not wake up.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 1 because the post expresses a sentiment (\"I wish I could just disappear\") that, while not directly equivalent to wishing to be dead, indicates a strong desire to escape one's emotional pain, aligning somewhat with the spirit of Q1, even though it doesn't directly fulfill the criteria."

        "llama_response": "To evaluate the given post step by step according to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics and assign a severity score, let's break down the information provided in the post.\n\n1. **Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? Severity: 1**\nThe post states, \"I'm 28 and lonely-nothing to live for\" and \"nothing feels worth living for.\" These statements indicate a wish for a state where the current suffering or emotional pain is alleviated, aligning with wishing they were dead or not waking up. Thus, **\"Q1\": \"The user expresses feeling like they have 'nothing to live for,' indicating a wish for a state of not being or not experiencing pain.\"**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post mentions being \"heart broken and lonely\" and having gone to the ER \"as a cry for help.\" The act of going to the ER could imply some level of distress that might include thoughts about killing themselves, but it's more directly related to seeking help. The statement \"nothing feels worth living for\" could be interpreted as having thoughts about suicide, though it's not explicit. Thus, **\"Q2\": \"The user's expression of having 'nothing to live for' and going to the ER as a 'cry for help' could imply some thoughts of suicide, though not directly stated.\"**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no direct mention or implication of thinking about the method of suicide in the post. Thus, **\"Q3\": \"N/A\"**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post doesn't clearly indicate an intention to act on suicidal thoughts. The visit to the ER was described as a \"cry for help,\" suggesting a desire for support rather than a direct intention to end their life at that moment. Thus, **\"Q4\": \"N/A\"**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication in the post that the user has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan. Thus, **\"Q5\": \"N/A\"**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post doesn't indicate any action taken towards ending their life. The ER visit was not followed through due to an 8-hour wait time, and there's no mention of preparation for suicide. Thus, **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"**\n\nGiven the above analysis, the post's severity is best reflected by the presence of a wish to not be alive (Severity: 1) and potential implication of having thoughts about suicide (Severity: 2). However, the post does not directly indicate active suicidal ideation with intent or plan (Severity: 4 and above).\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate severity score, based on the information provided, is 2, as the user implies having had thoughts that could be related to suicide, even though not directly stated.\n\nThe response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses feeling like they have 'nothing to live for,' indicating a wish for a state of not being or not experiencing pain.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user's expression of having 'nothing to live for' and going to the ER as a 'cry for help' could imply some thoughts of suicide, though not directly stated.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

It appears to be a comparative discussion about the severity of personal problems, with an expression of surprise or possibly empathy or one-upmanship regarding having \"way worse problems.\" Thus, it doesn't fulfill the criteria for any of the severity levels 1 through 6.\n\nThe response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates that the post is not related to suicide according to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics, hence a severity rating of 0."

They directly mention not having a purpose and questioning the point of continuing life, which aligns with wishing they were dead. **Q1: The user implies a wish not to be alive or to escape their suffering.**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe user explicitly states, \"why dont i just end it early,\" which indicates they have had thoughts about killing themselves or ending their life prematurely. **Q2: The statement \"why dont i just end it early\" directly implies thoughts about ending their life.**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no specific mention of how they might end their life; they simply state \"why dont i just end it early.\" **Q3: N/A, as there's no mention of a specific method.**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe user's statement \"why dont i just end it early\" suggests a contemplation that goes beyond just wishing to be dead; it implies considering taking action. However, the text doesn't clearly state an intention to act. **Q4: The user's thoughts could imply some level of intention, but it's not explicitly stated.**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

While there's an implication of potential intention (Q4), it's not strongly supported. The lack of specific plans or actions keeps the severity from being higher.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user implies a wish not to be alive or to escape their suffering.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement 'why dont i just end it early' directly implies thoughts about ending their life.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A, as there's no mention of a specific method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user's thoughts could imply some level of intention, but it's not explicitly stated.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A, as there's no mention of planning or details.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A, as there's no mention of taking action or preparing to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

Severity: 1**\nThe post doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. However, it expresses a deep despair and questioning of the worth of living under the described circumstances. Thus, while it doesn't directly fulfill this criterion, it implies a severe dissatisfaction with life. **Q1: N/A**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post does not explicitly mention thoughts of killing oneself. It focuses on the worthlessness of life under certain conditions rather than expressing a desire to end one's life. **Q2: N/A**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no indication in the post that the author is thinking about methods to end their life. **Q3: N/A**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post does not directly indicate any intention to act on suicidal thoughts, as it doesn't explicitly mention such thoughts. **Q4: N/A**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no evidence in the post that the author has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan. **Q5: N/A**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not indicate that the author has taken any action or made preparations to end their life. **Q6: N/A**\n\nThe post is a rhetorical expression of frustration and despair with the circumstances described, questioning the value of life under such conditions. While it conveys a deep sense of hopelessness and frustration with \"toxic positivity\" and \"false narratives\" about life's worth, it does not directly fulfill any of the criteria listed in the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE.\n\nHowever, given the intense emotional distress and the vivid description of a situation that is perceived as hopeless, one might argue it reflects a level of severity related to suicidal ideation, even though it's not directly expressed.\n\nThus, the JSON response based on the given analysis is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning behind assigning a severity of 1 is that while the post does not directly state a wish to be dead, it implies a deep wish for an escape from the current unbearable situation, aligning somewhat with the spirit of the first question, even though it doesn't directly fulfill it. The post's focus is more on the rhetorical questioning of life's worth under extreme hardship rather than an explicit expression of suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is on the lower end of the severity scale but not entirely absent of concern."

This implies a wish to not be alive or to escape their current situation, which aligns with wishing they were dead. Thus, **Q1: Relevant**.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** - The post directly states, \"I\u2019ve thought about just taking my life so it would be easier on everybody.\" This indicates that the individual has had thoughts about killing themselves.

Thus, **Q3: N/A**.\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** - The statement \"so it would be easier on everybody\" suggests a rationale behind their thought, which could be interpreted as some level of consideration or intention. However, the post doesn't explicitly state an intention to act on these thoughts. Thus, **Q4: N/A but leaning towards relevant due to the context**.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

Thus, **Q6: N/A**.\n\nThe severity is determined based on the most severe action or thought expressed. The individual has explicitly thought about killing themselves (Q2), which corresponds to a severity of 2. Although there's an implication of some rationale behind their suicidal thoughts, there's no clear indication of a specific plan or action.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The individual has been experiencing deep depression and has thought about taking their life, indicating a wish to not be alive.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post directly states thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis format adheres to the provided template and reflects the analysis of the post against the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics."

Thus, it fulfills this criterion.\n   - \"Q1\": The user is having suicidal thoughts, indicating a wish for death or a way out.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The user explicitly mentions having suicidal thoughts and considering methods, directly indicating thoughts about killing themselves.\n   - \"Q2\": The post directly mentions having thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The user is thinking about specific methods (decapitation by train, using a gun, but rules out OD, hanging, slitting wrist/throat) and is concerned about the efficacy and outcome of these methods.\n   - \"Q3\": The user is considering different methods for suicide.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - Although the user states they don\u2019t necessarily want to go through with the thoughts \"right now,\" they find comfort in knowing they can kill themselves anytime, suggesting some level of intention or preparedness to act if needed.\n   - \"Q4\": The user indicates having some level of intention or considering acting on their thoughts.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - The user is considering the details of methods (e.g., concerns about decapitation by train being slow or being pushed aside by a cow catcher) and has ruled out certain methods, indicating they are working out the details.\n   - The user does not have a gun and has not finalized a plan, but is thinking about it.\n   - \"Q5\": The user is working out the details but hasn't acquired the means (like a gun) or finalized a plan.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post does not indicate that the user has taken any action towards ending their life; they mention not having a gun, which is a necessary component for one of their considered methods.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no mention of having done or started to do anything to end their life.\n\nGiven these observations, the severity can be assessed as follows:\n\n- The user is having suicidal thoughts (\"Q1\" and \"Q2\" fulfilled).\n- They are thinking about methods (\"Q3\" fulfilled).\n- There's an indication of some intention to act, although it's conditional (\"Q4\" fulfilled).\n- They are working out the details of the methods but haven't carried out or prepared to carry out the plan (\"Q5\" partially fulfilled in terms of thinking, but not in terms of intending to carry out).\n\nThus, the highest severity level directly supported is \"Q4\" due to the conditional intention and the detailed consideration of methods. However, the level of detail and the contemplation of various methods suggest a high level of severity. Since they have not taken concrete steps towards acting on their thoughts (\"Q6\" not fulfilled), the severity is not at the maximum level.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": The user is having suicidal thoughts, indicating a wish for death or a way out.\n  \"Q2\": The post directly mentions having thoughts about killing themselves.\n  \"Q3\": The user is considering different methods for suicide.\n  \"Q4\": The user indicates having some level of intention or considering acting on their thoughts.\n  \"Q5\": The user is working out the details but hasn't acquired the means or finalized a plan.\n  \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no mention of having done or started to do anything to end their life.\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```\n\nThis assessment reflects that the user's statements directly correspond to having suicidal thoughts, thinking about methods, and having some level of intention, thereby warranting a severity rating of 4 according to the provided scale."

However, the user expresses a deep feeling of despair and emptiness, stating \"theres no saving me\" and \"i feel empty and nothing brings me joy anymore.\" While not directly answering 'yes', the sentiment is indicative of a deep unhappiness.

The overall tone and content suggest a significant level of distress, but without explicit statements regarding suicidal thoughts or intentions."

So, we can consider it as potentially implying a wish related to not being alive or escaping suffering, but it's not directly stated. **Q1: Implied but not directly stated**\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The post implies that the person has been thinking about \"doing it\" (implied as ending their life) for a long time. This suggests they have had thoughts about killing themselves. **Q2: Implied**\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The person explicitly states they have been thinking about doing it but are struggling to find a way to do so without suffering. This indicates they have been considering the method. **Q3: Yes**\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The post indicates a desire to act (\"hace mucho que pienso en hacerlo\") but is hindered by not wanting to suffer. This implies some level of intention. **Q4: Yes**\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - The person hasn't worked out the details yet (\"no encuentro la manera de hacerlo\"), indicating they are still in the process of considering how.

The statement \"Burnout is killing me\" could be interpreted as a metaphor for feeling extremely overwhelmed rather than a literal wish to be dead.

Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   Having a rope and alone time suggests some level of planning or considering the details. The statement doesn't explicitly say they worked out all the details, but having the means and time alone indicates some preparation.\n   - \"Q5\": Having a rope and two hours of alone time indicates some level of planning.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   The individual mentions having a rope and alone time, which can be seen as preparing to end their life. However, there's no explicit statement of having started to do anything to end their life.\n   - \"Q6\": Having a rope could be seen as preparing, but it stops short of confirming they've done or started anything.\n\nGiven the above analysis, here's the JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement 'I think I should just do it' directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The mention of having a rope indicates thinking about how to do it.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The statement 'I think I should just do it' implies having some intention.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Having a rope and two hours of alone time indicates some level of planning.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"Having a rope could be seen as preparing, but it stops short of confirming they've done or started anything.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\nHowever, upon careful consideration, while the individual has made some preparations (having a rope and alone time) and expressed thoughts of suicide with some intention, the severity is more accurately reflected by the presence of a clear plan and means, which aligns more closely with a severity of 5 or 6. The explicit mention of having a rope (a means) and alone time (an opportunity), along with the statement \"I think I should just do it,\" strongly suggests a high level of severity.\n\nThe most accurate severity level based on the provided information is **6** because the individual has prepared to end their life by having a rope and alone time, and there's an expressed thought of acting on it.\n\nTherefore, the corrected JSON remains as initially structured but is supported by the step-by-step analysis:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement 'I think I should just do it' directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The mention of having a rope indicates thinking about how to do it.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The statement 'I think I should just do it' implies having some intention.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Having a rope and two hours of alone time indicates some level of planning.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"Having a rope could be seen as preparing, but it stops short of confirming they've done or started anything.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```"

The phrase \"I can't take this anymore\" suggests a strong desire to escape their current situation or emotional state. Thus, it somewhat aligns with the criteria for Severity: 1.\n   - \"Q1\": The statement \"I can't take this anymore\" can be interpreted as wishing to escape their current emotional pain, potentially aligning with wishing to be dead or not wake up.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The post does not directly state thoughts about killing themselves but implies a negative self-view and feeling unwanted. The phrase \"I think the world can use one less of me\" suggests a belief that their absence would be beneficial or not harmful to others, which can be related to having thoughts about not being around.\n   - \"Q2\": The statement \"I think the world can use one less of me\" implies a passive thought that could be interpreted as related to having thoughts about their absence or death.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - There's no information in the post about thinking about methods of suicide.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no mention or implication of considering how to end their life.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The post does not directly indicate an intention to act on their negative thoughts or feelings.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A, as there's no clear indication of having an intention to act on their thoughts or feelings.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

Severity: 2**\nThe post indicates that the individual has not just thought about killing themselves but has taken significant steps towards it. So, this criterion is also indirectly fulfilled. Thus, \"Q2\": N/A.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThe post doesn't explicitly state that they have been thinking about the method, but it implies preparation (\"started writing down my last days,\" \"got rid of most of my things\").

While it doesn't explicitly state they have worked out the details of how to kill themselves, the preparations suggest a level of planning. Thus, \"Q5\": The post implies they have intended to carry out their plan.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe individual has taken concrete actions (\"started journaling my last days,\" \"got rid of most of my things,\" \"i just hope this time it works\") that indicate preparation to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": The post directly indicates that they have prepared to do something to end their life.\n\nGiven the information and the steps taken by the individual as described in the post, the severity is best represented by the highest level due to the explicit preparations and intentions to end their life.\n\nHere's the response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": The post implies they have intended to carry out their plan,\n  \"Q6\": The post directly indicates that they have prepared to do something to end their life,\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation concludes that the post should be assigned a severity of 6, as it directly indicates that the individual has prepared to end their life and has taken concrete steps towards that goal."

So, \"Q1\": The post implies a possible fulfillment of this criterion due to the overall context of distress.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The phrase \"or worse\" could imply thoughts beyond just harming oneself, potentially including killing oneself. Thus, \"Q2\": The post suggests the presence of thoughts that could be about killing oneself.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The post does not directly state that the individual has been thinking about the method of harming or killing themselves, but it doesn't rule it out either. So, \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no clear indication.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The post mentions \"can't stop thinking about harming myself or worse,\" indicating a preoccupation with harmful thoughts, but it doesn't directly state an intention to act.

So, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nThe severity level is determined by the highest severity question that is indicated by the post. The post most directly aligns with \"Q2\" ( Severity: 2) due to the implication of thoughts about killing oneself (\"or worse\").

The expression of being \"tired\" and \"can't do it anymore\" could be a cry for help or an expression of desperation.\n\n   \"Q2\": The post doesn't directly state having thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no mention or implication of thinking about methods to end one's life.\n\n   \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nAgain, the post doesn't directly mention any suicidal thoughts or intentions.\n\n   \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\nThere's no indication of planning or intending to end one's life.\n\n   \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThe post doesn't indicate any action or preparation towards ending one's life.\n\n   \"Q6\": N/A\n\n**Severity:**\nThe post indicates a state of extreme distress and hopelessness but does not directly express suicidal thoughts or intentions. The user's statement \"I'm tired... I can't do it anymore\" could be seen as a metaphor for their emotional state rather than a literal expression of suicidal ideation. However, the overall context suggests the user is at a low point and potentially vulnerable.\n\nGiven the closest related criteria:\n- \"Q1\": The user's expression of being \"tired\" and unable to continue could be seen as related to wishing they could escape their current state, potentially aligning with the spirit of Q1.\n\nThus, considering the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics and the analysis above, the severity is evaluated based on the closest relevant criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a state of extreme distress and hopelessness, suggesting the user might have wished they could escape their situation.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis response assigns a severity level of 1, as it is the closest relevant criteria based on the expression of extreme distress and a sense of hopelessness that could be interpreted as wishing for an escape from their current state. However, it is crucial to handle such expressions with care and consider reaching out for professional help."

It directly mentions having a plan and a long history of suicidal feelings. Thus, this criterion is indirectly met but is not the most severe aspect mentioned.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A (because it goes beyond this level)\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post explicitly states, \"I\u2019ve been suicidal on and off for about 15 years,\" indicating a history of suicidal thoughts.\n   - \"Q2\": The post fulfills this criterion as it directly mentions being suicidal.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post states, \"Already have my plan in place,\" indicating that the individual has thought about how to end their life.\n   - \"Q3\": The post fulfills this criterion.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The statement \"I\u2019ve made peace with my decision. Even a little bit excited\" suggests a strong intention to act on these thoughts.\n   - \"Q4\": The post fulfills this criterion.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - The individual mentions having a plan in place and timing its execution to minimize family trauma, indicating they have worked out the details and intend to carry out the plan.\n   - \"Q5\": The post fulfills this criterion.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - While the post doesn't explicitly state that the individual has started or prepared to end their life, it implies readiness and a specific timeline (\"don\u2019t see myself making it another 12 hours\").\n   - \"Q6\": N/A (The post implies preparation and intention but doesn't directly state actions taken or started.)\n\n### Step 2: Determining Severity\n\nGiven the details in the post, the individual:\n- Has a history of suicidal ideation (\"I\u2019ve been suicidal on and off for about 15 years\").\n- Has a plan in place (\"Already have my plan in place\").\n- Intends to act on it (\"I\u2019ve made peace with my decision\").\n- Has considered the timing to minimize family trauma, indicating they've worked out the details.\n\nThe most severe criterion directly supported by the post is **Q5** (Severity: 5), as it indicates the individual has worked out the details of how to kill themselves and intends to carry out the plan. The statement about not seeing themselves making it another 12 hours further emphasizes the immediacy of their intention.\n\n### JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post directly mentions being suicidal, fulfilling this criterion.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post states 'Already have my plan in place,' indicating thoughts on how to do it.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The individual expresses having made peace with their decision and being 'a little bit excited,' showing intention to act.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post indicates a plan is in place and details have been considered (e.g., timing to minimize family trauma), fulfilling this criterion.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the individual has started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill themselves and intends to carry out this plan, as indicated by their having a plan in place and planning its execution around a specific event (Christmas)."

Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"**\nThere's no clear evidence in the post of working out the details of a suicide plan.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no explicit mention of working out the details of a plan.\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"**\nThere's no indication in the post that the user has taken any action towards ending their life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no mention of taking action or preparing to end their life.\n\n**Severity Assessment:**\nGiven the information and the explicit wish to \"disappear without a trace\" and \"not be found,\" it suggests a significant level of distress and potential suicidal ideation, though not explicitly stated. The closest matching criterion is the wish to be dead or not wake up (Severity: 1), but the overall context suggests a higher severity due to the implication of a desire to end their existence.\n\nThe JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a wish to disappear, indicating a desire not to exist or be gone.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies a desire to not live anymore but doesn't directly state thoughts of killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user implies a desire for their body not to be found, suggesting some thought about the outcome of their death, but it's not a clear plan.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The expression of wishing to disappear and not be found could imply some intention, but it's not definitive.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A, as there's no explicit mention of working out the details of a plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A, as there's no mention of taking action or preparing to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 2 because the post implies having thoughts about not wanting to live anymore and wishing to disappear, which is more than just wishing to be dead or not wake up. It suggests actual thoughts about ending one's life or a strong desire not to exist, aligning more closely with Severity: 2, \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" even though it's not directly stated."

It discusses suicidal ideation and execution in a general or inquiring manner, not directly stating the author's wish. Hence, **\"Q1\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" (Severity: 2)**\n   - The post refers to \"suicidal ideations\" and \"executing their suicidal ideations,\" indicating thoughts about killing oneself are being discussed. However, it doesn't directly state that the author has had such thoughts; it's more about inquiring into others' experiences. Thus, **\"Q2\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" (Severity: 3)**\n   - The post does not directly indicate that the author or the people being referred to have thought about the methods of suicide. It's more focused on the transition from ideation to execution. So, **\"Q3\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" (Severity: 4)**\n   - The post implies that some individuals being referred to are \"on the verge of executing their suicidal ideations,\" suggesting intention. However, the author is not directly stating their own intentions or experiences. Hence, **\"Q4\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" (Severity: 5)**\n   - The post doesn't directly mention working out the details of a suicide plan. The discussion is more about the transition from having ideations to taking action. Thus, **\"Q5\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" (Severity: 6)**\n   - There's no indication in the post that the author or the individuals being discussed have taken or prepared to take action to end their lives. The language used (\"on the verge of executing\") suggests a potential or perceived risk but doesn't confirm action or preparation. So, **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"**.\n\nThe post is inquiring about the factors or events that lead individuals from having suicidal thoughts to attempting or committing suicide. It does not directly express suicidal ideation or intent by the author. However, it references others who might be at risk and is phrased in a way that could be interpreted as concerning or exploratory regarding suicidal behavior.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the severity rating should be based on the content directly related to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics. Since the post does not directly fulfill any of the criteria as per the scale (it's more of an inquiry into others' experiences and doesn't directly state the author's thoughts or actions), the severity is **0** because it doesn't directly relate to the author's personal experience of suicidal ideation or behavior.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```"

Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\nThe post doesn't explicitly state that they have worked out the details, but having the pills could imply some level of planning or consideration.\n\n   \"Q5\": Implies some level of planning or consideration with the mention of having pills.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThe post indicates they have the means (pills) but doesn't directly state they've taken any action towards using them.\n\n   \"Q6\": The post doesn't directly indicate that they have taken action or prepared to end their life.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies the person has lost their reason to live, suggesting they might wish they weren't alive.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies thoughts about using the pills, which could be related to killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The mention of having pills and their association with death implies consideration of how to end their life.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The implication is there but not directly stated; it suggests potential intent.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Implies some level of planning or consideration with the mention of having pills.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post doesn't directly indicate that they have taken action or prepared to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the post implies having thoughts about killing oneself (Q2), considering how to do it (Q3), and some level of planning or consideration (Q5) by mentioning the possession of pills and their lethal potential. While it doesn't directly state an action or preparation to end their life (Q6), the level of planning and consideration implied aligns most closely with a severity of 5."

However, the overall tone suggests a deep unhappiness and possibly a wish to escape their current state. So, \"Q1\": \"The post implies a sense of wanting to escape their misery, which could be interpreted as wishing to not be in their current state, though it's not directly stated.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** There's no direct mention or implication of thoughts about killing themselves. The focus is more on their current state of dysphoria and not being able to do healthy stuff. So, \"Q2\": \"N/A\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?** Since there's no indication of thoughts about killing themselves, this criterion isn't met. So, \"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?** Again, there's no direct or indirect indication of having thoughts about killing themselves or any intention to act on such thoughts. So, \"Q4\": \"N/A\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?** The post does not indicate that they have started to work out or have worked out details of killing themselves. So, \"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?** The post does not suggest that they have done, started to do, or prepared to do anything to end their life. So, \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the individual mentions taking about 2/3rds of their HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) to see what happens, which could be interpreted in different ways. If considering this action as related to self-harm or an attempt to alter their state significantly without a clear medical rationale provided, it could be a concern. However, in the context of HRT, which is a medical treatment, adjusting or stopping it might not directly imply an intent to end their life but could be related to their dysphoria and overall mental state.\n\nGiven the information and focusing strictly on the criteria provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a sense of wanting to escape their misery, which could be interpreted as wishing to not be in their current state, though it's not directly stated.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 1 because, while the post expresses significant distress and a sense of being overwhelmed, the closest matching criterion is the feeling of wishing they weren't in their current state, akin to wishing to escape their misery. The post does not directly indicate suicidal ideation or intent as per the other criteria. However, the overall tone and content suggest a need for support and understanding regarding their dysphoria and current mental state."

So, \"Q1\": The user expresses a sentiment that can be interpreted as wishing to escape their current painful situation.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"\nThe user mentions \"3 failed attempts in 2 days,\" directly indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves and have acted on them.

However, it's not directly stated.\n   - \"Q1\": \"Implied by the context of considering harm and expressing exhaustion.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The mention of \"open the brachial\" is a reference to self-harm or potentially suicide, as it could imply cutting the brachial artery, a lethal action. This suggests thoughts about killing oneself.\n   - \"Q2\": \"The mention of 'open the brachial' implies thoughts about a lethal self-harm method.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The specific mention of \"open the brachial\" indicates consideration of a method, showing thought about how to potentially end one's life.\n   - \"Q3\": \"The post directly references considering a specific lethal method.\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The question \"Do I open the brachial or do I keep trying?\" suggests a deliberation between taking a potentially lethal action and continuing with their current state, implying some level of intention or consideration to act.\n   - \"Q4\": \"The deliberation implies an intention or serious consideration to act.\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - The post indicates that the individual has considered a specific method (\"open the brachial\"), suggesting some level of planning or thought about the details. The deliberation (\"Do I... or do I keep trying\") implies intent.\n   - \"Q5\": \"The specific method considered and the deliberation imply working out details and intending to carry out the plan.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - There's no direct indication in the post that the individual has taken concrete steps towards ending their life, though the language used is concerning and indicative of serious consideration.\n   - \"Q6\": \"N/A as there's no direct evidence of action or preparation to act.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the post most directly fulfills criteria up to Q5 due to the implication of considering a specific method and the intent behind the deliberation. Therefore, the severity is best rated as 5, as it involves having started to work out the details of how to kill oneself and intending to carry out the plan.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied by the context of considering harm and expressing exhaustion.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The mention of 'open the brachial' implies thoughts about a lethal self-harm method.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post directly references considering a specific lethal method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The deliberation implies an intention or serious consideration to act.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The specific method considered and the deliberation imply working out details and intending to carry out the plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A as there's no direct evidence of action or preparation to act.\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```"

Thus, \"Q1\": N/A.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post does not explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself. The statement \"i quit I cant do it\" is related to giving up on handling adult responsibilities, not directly indicating suicidal thoughts. So, \"Q2\": N/A.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no mention or implication of thinking about methods of suicide. Hence, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe post does not indicate having thoughts about suicide or any intention to act on such thoughts. Therefore, \"Q4\": N/A.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

Thus, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nThe post is more about feeling overwhelmed by the challenges of being an adult, such as managing classes, expenses, and personal responsibilities, rather than expressing suicidal thoughts or intentions. The severity should be rated based on the closest relevant criteria.\n\nThe closest interpretation is that the person is expressing a strong desire to \"quit\" or give up due to feeling overwhelmed, which could be somewhat aligned with wishing they didn't have to deal with their situation anymore. However, this is not directly equivalent to wishing they were dead.\n\nGiven the information and the closest match, the post is related to feeling hopeless and overwhelmed, which might be somewhat aligned with the first question's severity level due to the expression of not being able to handle the situation (\"i quit I cant do it. Its too hard\"). However, it's a stretch to directly relate it to suicidal ideation as per the scale.\n\nTherefore, while not perfectly aligned with any of the criteria directly, if we had to choose a severity level based on the emotional distress and feeling overwhelmed expressed, it would be more about the emotional state rather than specific suicidal ideation.\n\nThe JSON response based on the given analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post expresses frustration and feeling overwhelmed, but not directly wishing to be dead.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that assigning a severity of 1 might still be considered a stretch because the post doesn't directly indicate wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up. A more accurate severity might be considered as 0 if adhering strictly to the provided metrics and understanding that the post, while distressing, does not directly relate to suicidal ideation.\n\nThus, a more appropriate response might be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```"

Thus, \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" \nThe user's statement, \"I want to kill myself,\" indicates having thoughts about killing themselves, and the context suggests an emotional state where they are struggling with the idea, implying some level of intention.

Thus, it can be inferred that they have wished they were dead.\n   - **Q1: The post implies a wish not to be alive.**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post directly mentions \"I tried to commit suicide multiple times,\" indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves.\n   - **Q2: The post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts.**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - While the post doesn't explicitly state that they are currently thinking about how to kill themselves, it does mention past attempts.

The user has a history of suicide attempts (Q6), has had intentions to act on suicidal thoughts (Q4), and has expressed a wish not to be alive (Q1). The presence of past attempts (Severity: 6) is a significant indicator.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish not to be alive.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A, as there's no explicit mention of currently thinking about the method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies past intentions to act on suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Implied by past attempts, but not explicitly stated for current plans.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 6 because the post explicitly mentions past suicide attempts, directly fulfilling the criteria for the highest severity level according to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics."

So, \"Q1\": \"N/A\" because it's not directly stated.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?

The severity is thus determined to be 4, as the user indicates having thoughts of suicide and an intention to act, but there's no evidence they've planned or taken steps towards it.\n\nThe JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a desire to rest and escape their daily suffering.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user mentions considering the impact on their family, suggesting they've thought about suicide.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user indicates they can't take it anymore, suggesting an intention or strong consideration.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

Hohoho 28m 27f two kids 9-2\". At face value, it's about someone discovering their spouse is having an affair with their brother in their own home.\n\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Against the Metrics\n\n1. **Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?**\n   - The post does not directly express a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. It's more about a personal crisis related to infidelity.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - There's no explicit mention of thoughts about killing oneself. The post seems to focus on the shock or reaction to discovering an affair.\n   - \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post doesn't discuss or imply any method of suicide.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - Intention to act on suicidal thoughts is not mentioned or implied.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - There's no indication of planning or intending to carry out a suicide plan.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post does not suggest any action towards ending one's life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A\n\n\n### Step 3: Assigning Severity\nThe post is about a personal crisis related to discovering infidelity but does not directly or indirectly relate to suicidal thoughts or actions as per the given metrics. Thus, it does not fit into any of the severity levels 1 through 6.\n\n\n### Response in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 0 because the post is not related to suicide according to the provided metrics."

However, the immediate intention to act (\"tonight\") and the implication of preparation suggest a high level of severity.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a wish not to be alive, 'I have no will to live.'\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user has thoughts about killing themselves, 'I'm planning to die tonight.'\",\n  \"Q3\": \"Implied, as the user is 'planning to die tonight.'\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user has both thoughts and intention to act on them, 'I'm planning to die tonight.'\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The user implies having a plan and intending to carry it out, 'my parents are totally unaware what I'm planning.'\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the user has impliedly worked out a plan and intends to carry it out, which directly corresponds to the criteria for severity level 5. The absence of an explicit statement regarding having done, started, or prepared anything to end their life (Q6) prevents it from being categorized as a 6, despite the clear intent and implication of planning."

It mentions a specific action (taking 5000mg of paracetamol) rather than a general wish. Thus, it's more directly related to a method or action than a general wish for death or sleep.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" (Severity: 2)**\n   - The post implies consideration of a potentially lethal action (taking a large dose of paracetamol), which can be interpreted as having thoughts about killing oneself, albeit indirectly.

However, the fact that they're asking about a potentially lethal dose implies some level of consideration.\n   - \"Q4\": The post suggests some level of consideration or curiosity about the lethal potential of paracetamol, but the intention is not clear.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" (Severity: 5)**\n   - The user is asking about the effect of a specific dose, which implies they have some details in mind (the substance and the dose).

However, there's no clear intention to act (though it's ambiguous), and no evidence of working out or intending to carry out a detailed plan or taking action.\n\nGiven these observations, the closest matching severity would be related to having thoughts about killing oneself and considering a method. Therefore, the most relevant severity level seems to be around 3, as it directly involves thinking about a specific method.\n\nHere's the JSON response based on the template:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies having thoughts about killing oneself by considering the effect of an overdose.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post indicates thinking about a specific method (overdosing on paracetamol).\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post suggests some level of consideration or curiosity about the lethal potential of paracetamol, but the intention is not clear.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 3\n}\n```\n\nThis response reflects the analysis and assigns a severity level of 3, as the post directly implies thinking about a specific method of suicide (overdosing on paracetamol) without clear evidence of further planning or action."

It mentions a \"really bad episode\" that left the writer's leg in a bad state, implying self-harm but not directly stating a wish to be dead. Thus, **\"Q1\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post does not explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself. The concern is about hiding scars from a partner, implying self-harm but not directly indicating suicidal thoughts. Hence, **\"Q2\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - There's no direct mention of thinking about how to kill oneself. The post implies self-harm (\"a really bad episode\") but doesn't detail planning or thinking about suicide methods. So, **\"Q3\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The post doesn't indicate having thoughts about suicide or intention to act on them. It focuses on hiding the consequences of a past action (self-harm). Thus, **\"Q4\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - The post doesn't mention working out details of a suicide plan or intending to carry one out. The concern is about the reaction of the partner to the scars, not about suicide planning. Therefore, **\"Q5\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - While the post implies that the writer has engaged in self-harm (\"a really bad episode that left my leg in a bad state\"), it doesn't directly state that the action was intended to end their life. The immediate concern is about hiding the scars. However, the fact that they had a \"really bad episode\" and their partner has been trying to help them stop implies self-harm. Yet, the context suggests the action wasn't directly aimed at ending their life but rather possibly a coping mechanism or a manifestation of distress. Hence, while there's an implication of self-harm, it's not directly framed as an attempt to end their life. So, **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"**.\n\nGiven the information and focusing on the C-SSRS metrics, the post doesn't directly answer any of the questions with a clear affirmative related to suicidal ideation or behavior as defined by the scale. The closest implication is of self-harm, but the primary concern expressed is the fear of the partner's reaction to the scars, not suicidal intent.\n\nTherefore, the severity score based on the C-SSRS, given that there's no direct indication of suicidal ideation or planning, would be **0**, as the post is related to distress and self-harm but not explicitly to suicide.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```"

Thus, \"Q2\": The post explicitly states a desire to kill oneself.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** Severity: 3  \nThe post does not provide any details on how the individual might kill themselves. Thus, \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** Severity: 4  \nThe repetition of \"I WANT TO KMS\" could imply a certain level of intention or strong desire, but it does not directly indicate a clear intention to act on these thoughts at the moment. Thus, \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"** Severity: 5  \nThere's no mention of working out or having worked out the details of a plan to kill oneself. Thus, \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"** Severity: 6  \nThe post does not indicate that the individual has taken any action or made preparations to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven the explicit expression of a desire to kill oneself (\"I WANT TO KMS\"), the post directly corresponds to **Q2** (\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\") with a severity of 2. Although it shows a strong and repeated desire to die by suicide, it doesn't escalate to the higher severity levels as it lacks details on planning or acting on these thoughts.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": The post explicitly states a desire to kill oneself,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation is based on the information provided and the specific criteria of the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE."

So, while it's possible the individual had such feelings, the statement is more aligned with having taken action. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The action of taking a handful of olanzapine implies that the individual had thoughts about killing themselves. Thus, \"Q2\": The individual took an overdose, indicating they had thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The fact that the individual took a specific action (overdosing on olanzapine) indicates they had considered how to end their life. Thus, \"Q3\": The act of taking olanzapine suggests they thought about the method.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The individual not only had thoughts but acted on them, indicating an intention. Thus, \"Q4\": The individual took olanzapine, showing they had the intention to act on their thoughts.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - By taking olanzapine, the individual has shown they worked out a method (taking pills) and intended to carry it out. Thus, \"Q5\": The act of taking the pills and stating \"Just waiting now\" indicates they had worked out the details and intended to carry out the plan.\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The individual has taken a handful of olanzapine, which directly fulfills this criterion. Thus, \"Q6\": The individual has done something (taken an overdose) to end their life.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the post directly corresponds to the most severe category as the individual has taken action to end their life.\n\nThe JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The individual took an overdose, indicating they had thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The act of taking olanzapine suggests they thought about the method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The individual took olanzapine, showing they had the intention to act on their thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The act of taking the pills and stating 'Just waiting now' indicates they had worked out the details and intended to carry out the plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The individual has done something (taken an overdose) to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```"

However, the sentiment \"I see no point in even trying anymore\" is indicative of a significant level of distress and hopelessness. While it doesn't directly map onto wishing to be dead, it suggests a severe level of despair.\n\n   \"Q1\": N/A (though there's a sense of hopelessness)\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post doesn't explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself.

The post expresses a feeling of hopelessness and frustration about the future (\"I see no point in even trying anymore\"), which is concerning. However, it doesn't directly indicate suicidal ideation or intent as per the scale.\n\nGiven the severe sense of hopelessness and despair expressed, but lacking a direct reference to suicidal thoughts or actions, we need to determine the closest severity level. The statement \"I see no point in even trying anymore\" is most closely aligned with the sentiment assessed in **Q1**, as it reflects a level of despair that could be interpreted as wishing for an escape, though not directly stated.\n\nTherefore, the severity is best rated as 1, due to the expression of a sentiment that implies a wish to escape one's circumstances, akin to wishing to be dead or not wake up, even though it's not a direct expression of such a wish.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The sentiment 'I see no point in even trying anymore' suggests a level of hopelessness that could be related to wishing to escape one's circumstances.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```"

So, \"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nAgain, there's no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts or intentions. So, \"Q4\": \"N/A\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\nThe post does not indicate that the individual has made any plans. So, \"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThere's no evidence in the post that the individual has taken or prepared to take any action to end their life. So, \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nThe post's tone is despairing and includes a \"Goodbye,\" which might suggest a level of giving up or hopelessness. While it indicates a significant level of distress and dissatisfaction with life (\"I'm tired of everything\"), it doesn't directly address or imply any specific suicidal ideation or behavior as per the Columbia scale questions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the closest match from the Columbia scale is the first question due to the overall tone of despair and the \"Goodbye\" at the end, which could be interpreted as a wish not to be part of the world anymore or a form of emotional goodbye.\n\nThus, the severity is rated as 1, as it's the closest related to the expressed sentiment of being tired of everything and the implied hopelessness.\n\nHere is the JSON response based on the template:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied hopelessness\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```"

Severity: 1**\nThe post mentions being filled with anxiety, depression, and stress, and indicates that self-harming is used as a coping mechanism. While it doesn't directly state wishing to be dead or go to sleep and not wake up, the overall tone suggests a significant level of distress. However, this specific wish is not directly mentioned. Thus, the direct fulfillment of this criterion is not clear, but the context implies a deeper issue. \"N/A\" might be too dismissive since the overall sentiment is related to severe distress, but directly it's \"N/A\".\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post explicitly mentions \"Whenever I get suicidal thoughts,\" which directly indicates having thoughts about killing oneself. Thus, \"Q2\": \"The post explicitly mentions having suicidal thoughts.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThe post doesn't explicitly mention thinking about how to kill oneself; it mentions cutting as a form of self-harm, not as a method to end life. So, \"Q3\": \"N/A\" because it doesn't indicate planning or thinking about how to kill oneself.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post indicates having suicidal thoughts and feeling anxious about them but doesn't directly state an intention to act on these suicidal thoughts. It differentiates between suicidal thoughts and self-harming behaviors. Thus, \"Q4\": \"N/A\" since there's no clear indication of an intention to act on suicidal thoughts.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication in the post that the individual has worked out or is working out the details of a suicide plan. So, \"Q5\": \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not indicate any actions taken or preparations made to end life. The actions mentioned (cutting) are related to self-harm, not explicitly to ending life. Thus, \"Q6\": \"N/A\".\n\nGiven the information and the metrics provided:\n\n- The post directly mentions having suicidal thoughts, fulfilling Q2.\n- The other criteria are either not directly related or not mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the severity is at least 2 due to the explicit mention of having suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post explicitly mentions having suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

However, it does not directly state a wish to be dead or to not wake up. The emotional pain is highlighted, but there's no explicit mention of wishing for death or not waking up. Thus, \"N/A\" for this specific criteria, but the emotional distress is notable.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post does not explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself. It discusses feelings of loss and emotional pain but doesn't directly reference suicidal thoughts. So, \"N/A\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no indication in the post that the individual has considered methods of suicide. The focus is on the emotional impact of the dream and the feeling of never experiencing affection. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nAs there's no mention of suicidal thoughts or intentions, this criterion is not met.

The post discusses emotional pain and distress but doesn't suggest any suicidal actions.

So, \"Q5\": The post implies working out details and intending to carry out the plan.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**  \n   The post directly states making \"attempts\" and trying specific methods (reaching arteries, hanging), indicating actions taken towards ending life.

Thus, **Q1: N/A** because it's more severe than just wishing.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**  \nThe post indicates the individual has not just thought about killing themselves but has taken concrete actions. So, **Q2: N/A** because the situation is more severe.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**  \nThe individual mentions taking about 310,000 mg of methanol, showing they have thought about how to end their life.

Hence, **Q1: N/A**.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The post does not explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself.

Severity: 1**\n   The post doesn't directly indicate that the author has wished they were dead or wished to go to sleep and not wake up. Instead, it seems to be addressing someone who might be having such thoughts. Thus, it doesn't fulfill this criterion directly for the author, but the context implies the existence of such thoughts in the person being addressed. **\"Q1\": N/A**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\n   The post is cautioning someone against taking a certain action (\"Don't do it\") and mentions \"before you commite\" (likely meaning \"commit\"), which implies the action is suicide. The post acknowledges the existence of thoughts about suicide in the person being addressed but doesn't directly state the author has had such thoughts. **\"Q2\": N/A**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   There's no direct evidence in the post that the author or the person being addressed has thought about the method of suicide. The post doesn't discuss methods. **\"Q3\": N/A**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   The post is trying to deter someone from acting on suicidal thoughts or intentions, suggesting that the person being addressed might have some level of intention. However, it doesn't directly indicate the author's intentions or current state. **\"Q4\": N/A**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\n   The post does not mention working out details of a suicide plan for either the author or the person being addressed. **\"Q5\": N/A**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\n   The post is cautioning against taking action (\"Don't do it\"), implying that the person might be on the verge of or considering taking action to end their life. However, it doesn't state that the author has taken such actions. **\"Q6\": N/A**\n\nGiven the context of the post, it's clear that the author is responding to or addressing someone who may be contemplating suicide. The severity level isn't directly applicable to the author's expressed state but is related to the state of the person being addressed.\n\nSince the post itself is a response to someone contemplating suicide and is encouraging them not to act on it, and there's no direct indication that the author themselves is experiencing suicidal thoughts or intentions, the severity rating based directly on the author's statements isn't applicable in the traditional sense. However, the post's content and the context imply concern for someone who might be at risk.\n\nThe response in JSON format based on the analysis:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON response reflects that the post itself does not directly indicate the author is experiencing suicidal thoughts or intentions as per the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics. The \"severity\": 0 indicates the post is not directly related to the author's own suicidal ideation or behavior but is rather a response to someone else's potential crisis."

However, the exact phrase \"wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up\" isn't directly used. The sentiment is more about giving up on trying to form connections rather than a direct wish to be dead. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A, but with some related sentiment.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" \n   - The post mentions \"I feel like stopping it forever and not to try to approach anyone.\" The phrase \"stopping it forever\" is ambiguous and could be interpreted as giving up on social interactions or life in general. It implies a severe level of distress. Thus, \"Q2\": The sentiment is somewhat related as it implies a form of giving up that could be associated with suicidal thoughts.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" \n   - There's no mention of methods or planning. Thus, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" \n   - The statement \"I feel like stopping it forever\" is somewhat suggestive of an intention, but it's not clear if it's directly related to suicide.

Thus, \"Q4\": The sentiment is somewhat related, but it's not a clear indication.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

Thus, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the closest matching criteria that indicate a level of severity are Q1 and Q2, due to the sentiment of giving up and the implication of a severe emotional state. However, the language used doesn't directly align with the criteria for Q1 or clearly indicate suicidal ideation as in Q2. The post expresses a deep sense of loneliness and frustration, and the phrase \"I feel like stopping it forever\" could be seen as related to Q2, leaning towards a severity level related to having thoughts about ending one's life or giving up.\n\nThe JSON response based on the analysis is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A, though implies a related sentiment of giving up\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The sentiment implies a form of giving up that could be associated with suicidal thoughts\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The sentiment is somewhat related, implying frustration and giving up\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation assigns a severity level of 2 because the post implies having thoughts that could be related to or interpreted as suicidal ideation (\"I feel like stopping it forever\"), but it doesn't clearly outline a plan or intent to act on such thoughts. The overall tone and content suggest a significant level of distress and frustration, indicating a need for support."

The statement \"I'm really thinking about it\" is concerning and suggests that the individual is having some level of suicidal ideation, aligning more closely with Q2.\n\nTherefore, the severity is best categorized as 2 because the individual has \"actually had any thoughts about killing yourself\" as inferred from their statement.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a sense of being overwhelmed that could be interpreted as a wish to escape their current life situation\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement 'I'm really thinking about it' could be interpreted as having thoughts about killing themselves, though it's not explicit\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

Thus, \"Q1\": N/A doesn't fully capture the hopelessness expressed.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe user explicitly states, \"I find the idea of killing myself to avoid the consequences increasingly tempting.\" This directly indicates they have had thoughts about killing themselves, so \"Q2\": The user has had thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no mention of the user thinking about the method of killing themselves. Hence, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe post indicates the idea of killing themselves is \"increasingly tempting,\" which suggests some level of consideration or inclination towards acting on these thoughts, but it doesn't clearly state an intention.

Since the user has had thoughts about killing themselves (\"Q2\") and there's an implication of some intention or inclination towards these thoughts (\"Q4\"), but no clear plan or action, the most applicable severity level based on the given metrics is related to having thoughts about killing themselves and some inclination towards acting on them.\n\nTherefore, the most severe applicable level here is 2 because they have actually had thoughts about killing themselves.

Severity: 2**\n   The phrase \"How do I make it stop\" could be interpreted as seeking a solution to their distress, potentially hinting at suicidal thoughts as a means to end their suffering, though it's not explicit.\n   - \"Q2\": The language used suggests a strong need for relief, possibly indicating thoughts about ending their life as a way to stop their pain.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   The post does not directly indicate that the person has been thinking about the method to end their life or their suffering.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no specific mention or implication of considering a method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   The post does not clearly indicate an intention to act on any thoughts they might have.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A, as the post doesn't directly mention having an intention to act.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

Severity: 6**\n   The post doesn't indicate any action or preparation towards ending their life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no indication of preparation or action taken.\n\nGiven the analysis, the post suggests the person is experiencing significant distress (\"It won't stop\") and is seeking a way to end their suffering (\"How do I make it stop\"). While it doesn't directly indicate suicidal thoughts or plans, the language used implies a strong desire for relief from their emotional pain, which could be interpreted as potentially having wished they were dead or wished to sleep and not wake up.\n\nThe most fitting severity level appears to be 1, as it implies a wish to escape their current state of distress, which could be aligned with wishing to be dead or not wake up. The severity is somewhat subjective based on interpretation.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a strong desire for relief from suffering.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The language used suggests a strong need for relief, possibly indicating thoughts about ending their life as a way to stop their pain.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```"

Severity:1**\n   - The post expresses frustration with people being rude and a desire not to be around humans anymore. While it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up, the sentiment of not wanting to be around humans can be interpreted as a form of withdrawal or escapism, which might be related to the first question. However, it's not a direct expression of wishing to be dead. So, the reasoning here leans towards a potential indirect expression but is not a clear \"yes.\"\n   - **\"Q1\": \"N/A but with some indirect frustration\"**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\n   - There's no explicit mention or implication of thoughts about killing oneself in the post. The statement \"I don't want to be around humans anymore\" is more about social frustration than suicidal ideation.\n   - **\"Q2\": \"N/A\"**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   - Since there's no indication of suicidal thoughts, there's also no indication of thinking about how to act on such thoughts.\n   - **\"Q3\": \"N/A\"**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\n   - As established, there's no clear indication of having thoughts about killing oneself, let alone intending to act on them.\n   - **\"Q4\": \"N/A\"**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\n   - There's no evidence or implication of planning or intending to carry out a suicidal act.\n   - **\"Q5\": \"N/A\"**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\n   - The post does not indicate any action or preparation towards ending one's life.\n   - **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"**\n\nGiven the above analysis, the post does express a negative sentiment and frustration but does not directly or indirectly indicate a clear suicidal ideation or plan according to the metrics provided. The closest related interpretation could be the expression of not wanting to be around humans, which is more related to social withdrawal or frustration rather than a direct wish to be dead.\n\nThe severity, in this case, is considered to be **0** because the post, while expressing negative sentiments and frustration with social interactions, does not directly relate to or indicate suicidal ideation or behaviors as per the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale metrics.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```"

Thus, fulfilling the criteria for Severity: 2.\n   \"Q2\": The user explicitly mentions considering suicide.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The user mentions they \"even start to look for options,\" which implies they are thinking about the method or ways to end their life.

The individual has already attempted suicide, so the method has been considered and acted upon previously.\n\n### Q4: Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\nThe statement \"sleeping forever doesn't seem so bad\" indicates a passive wish rather than an active intention to act on suicidal thoughts at the moment.\n\n### Q5: Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\nThere's no indication that the individual is currently planning or has worked out details to attempt suicide again.\n\n### Q6: Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\nThe individual has already attempted suicide (\"I attempted to take my life on a Tuesday night\") but there's no indication of current preparations or actions towards another attempt.\n\n### Severity Evaluation:\n- The post fulfills Q1 because the individual expresses a wish related to not being alive.\n- It fulfills Q2 as there are thoughts about killing oneself.\n- It does not directly fulfill Q3 as there's no mention of current thoughts on methods.\n- It somewhat fulfills Q4 due to the expressed wish, but it's more of a passive wish than an active intention.\n- It does not fulfill Q5 as there's no indication of planning.\n- The individual has done something to end their life in the past (fulfilling Q6 in the past tense), but there's no indication of current actions or preparations.\n\nGiven the details, the post is most closely related to having had thoughts about killing oneself and having made an attempt in the past.

Although there's a mention of wishing for \"sleeping forever,\" which indicates some level of suicidal ideation, the overall context suggests that the current intention or plan is not actively being pursued as it was in the past."

So, while it's not a direct match, the sentiment of not wanting to continue in the current state is implied. Thus, \"Q1\": \"Implied a desire to escape the emotional pain, which could be related to wishing to not be in the current state.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post explicitly states, \"I'm currently having suicidal thoughts.\" This directly fulfills the criteria for Q2. Thus, \"Q2\": \"Explicitly mentioned having suicidal thoughts.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post does not mention any thoughts or plans about how to kill themselves. Thus, \"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - While the post mentions having suicidal thoughts, it doesn't directly indicate an intention to act on them. The individual is seeking comfort and support (\"badly wanna make him come home and help me\"), which suggests they are looking for an alternative to acting on their suicidal thoughts. Thus, \"Q4\": \"N/A\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - There's no indication in the post that the individual has started to work out or has worked out the details of a plan to kill themselves. Thus, \"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post doesn't indicate that the individual has taken any action or made preparations to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nGiven the explicit mention of having suicidal thoughts (Q2), the severity is at least 2. There's no evidence to support a higher severity level based on the provided metrics.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied a desire to escape the emotional pain, which could be related to wishing to not be in the current state\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Explicitly mentioned having suicidal thoughts\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

Thus, **Q1: N/A**.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThere's no explicit or implicit mention of thoughts about killing oneself in the post. Hence, **Q2: N/A**.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nSince there's no indication of thoughts about killing oneself, it follows that there's no indication of thinking about how to do it. So, **Q3: N/A**.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post does not suggest any thoughts of suicide or intentions to act on them, so **Q4: N/A**.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

Thus, **Q6: N/A**.\n\nThe post \"i need someone to talk to\" suggests a need for support or conversation, which could be related to various emotional or psychological states but does not directly indicate suicidality. While it could be interpreted as a cry for help, it doesn't explicitly fulfill any of the C-SSRS criteria directly. However, given the context that someone is reaching out for talk, it might be an indicator of emotional distress.\n\nGiven the lack of direct evidence for any of the severity metrics, the **severity: 0** because the post is not directly related to expressing suicidal thoughts or intentions as per the C-SSRS metrics.

Severity: 2**\nThe statement \"I just wanna let it all go... I just want it to be over\" and \"the only thing keeping me here is how hard it is to make that happen\" can be interpreted as having thoughts about ending their life, as it implies a desire for death or an end to their suffering.

Severity: 4**\nThe statement \"the only thing keeping me here is how hard it is to make that happen\" suggests that the individual has some level of intention to act on their thoughts of ending their life, as it indicates that the barrier is not a lack of desire but the difficulty in executing it.

Severity: 5**\nThe post does not provide evidence that the individual has started to work out the details of ending their life.

The statement doesn't directly indicate that they've started to do anything or prepared to do anything to end their life in the sense of having taken tangible steps (like obtaining means), but the planning is detailed.

So, \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nThe overall severity is determined by the highest level of severity that is not N/A. The post most directly aligns with the first severity level due to its expression of extreme distress and a sentiment that could be interpreted as wishing to escape their suffering. However, it does imply a consideration of not continuing life, which goes beyond just wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up.\n\nTherefore, \"severity\": 2, because while the post directly implies distress and a potential wish to not continue as is, it doesn't directly state thoughts of killing themselves but implies a step beyond just wishing to be dead.\n\nHere's the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The sentiment is somewhat aligned with wishing to not be in their current state, implying a potential wish to escape their suffering.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies a consideration of not continuing life as it is, but doesn't directly state thoughts of killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

While it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead, the context of abuse and feeling ignored could be interpreted as potentially leading to such thoughts. However, it's not directly stated, so we'll consider it as \"N/A\" for now, but leaning towards a potential \"1\" due to the implied distress.\n\n   \"Q1\": \"N/A but potentially implied due to the situation described\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The post doesn't directly mention thoughts of killing themselves. It focuses on the problem (abuse) and the perceived lack of support. Thus, we can't directly infer this from the given text.\n\n   \"Q2\": \"N/A\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   There's no mention or implication of the person thinking about methods to end their life.\n\n   \"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   As the previous questions weren't directly answered or implied in the post, this remains \"N/A\".\n\n   \"Q4\": \"N/A\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The closest related metric is \"Q1\" due to the potential implication of feeling hopeless or wishing for an escape from the situation. However, it's not a direct indication.\n\nTherefore, the severity is best rated based on the implied level of distress and the context, rather than a direct answer to the questions. Since there's an implication of significant distress but no direct indication of suicidal ideation or action, a conservative approach is to consider it as not directly related to the severity scale's higher metrics but still acknowledging the distress.\n\nThe severity rating, in this case, is more about the context and potential underlying feelings rather than explicit statements. The post implies a need for support.\n\n\"severity\": 1\n\nHere's the JSON response based on the above analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A but potentially implied due to the situation described\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```"

Severity: 1**\nThe user expresses hatred towards their emotional state and themselves, indicating a strong negative feeling but doesn't explicitly wish to be dead or not wake up. However, the phrase \"I hate myself\" could be interpreted as a deep-seated negative self-feeling that might be related to wishing not to be alive. Yet, it's not a direct wish to be dead or not wake up. So, \"Q1\": \"N/A but somewhat related due to self-hatred\".\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe user explicitly states, \"I'm not going to kill myself,\" which directly negates having current intentions or thoughts about killing themselves. This indicates they might have had such thoughts in the past or are aware of the possibility but are denying current intent. So, \"Q2\": \"N/A because the user directly denies current suicidal thoughts or intentions\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no indication in the post that the user has been thinking about methods of suicide. The explicit denial of suicidal intent (\"I'm not going to kill myself\") and the absence of any discussion about methods or planning suggest this is not applicable. So, \"Q3\": \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?

So, \"Q4\": \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no mention or implication that the user has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan. So, \"Q5\": \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not indicate any action or preparation towards ending their life. The user is using the platform to \"vent,\" which could be seen as a cry for help or support, but there's no direct evidence of preparation or action towards suicide. So, \"Q6\": \"N/A\".\n\nGiven the analysis, the user's post indicates distress and negative feelings but does not directly indicate suicidal ideation or intent according to the specific criteria of the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. The explicit statement denying suicidal intent and the lack of discussion about methods or planning suggest a lower severity.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A but somewhat related due to self-hatred\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A because the user directly denies current suicidal thoughts or intentions\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning for assigning a severity of 1 is based on the user's expression of self-hatred and emotional distress, which could be tangentially related to wishing not to be alive (Q1), even though it's not a direct expression of wishing to be dead or not wake up. The denial of suicidal intent and the absence of other indicators across the scale support not assigning a higher severity."

It talks about fantasizing about cutting wrists. Thus, \"N/A\" for this specific criteria, but the overall content suggests a deeper issue.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** \n   - The post talks about fantasizing about cutting wrists, which implies having thoughts about harming oneself, not directly stated as killing oneself, but it involves a self-harming act. So, \"The user has thoughts about harming themselves\" fulfills a related criteria.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?** \n   - The post explicitly states, \"I know exactly where to cut,\" indicating that the user has been thinking about how to harm themselves. Thus, \"The user knows exactly where to cut, indicating they have thought about the method.\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?** \n   - The user mentions looking at their wrists with a razor in hand and fantasizing about cutting, indicating an intention or a strong inclination towards acting on these thoughts, though they state they stop themselves. So, \"The user had thoughts and some intention as evidenced by holding a razor and knowing where to cut.\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?** \n   - The post indicates that the user has thought about the details of harming themselves (\"I know exactly where to cut\"), suggesting some level of planning. It doesn't directly state an intention to carry out the act to the point of suicide, but it implies a significant level of detail in their fantasies. So, \"The user has worked out the details of self-harm.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?** \n   - The user states they held a razor and contemplated cutting but stopped themselves, indicating they didn't actually do anything to end their life. Thus, \"The user stopped themselves from acting.\"\n\nGiven the analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user has thoughts about harming themselves\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user knows exactly where to cut, indicating they have thought about the method\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user had thoughts and some intention as evidenced by holding a razor and knowing where to cut\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The user has worked out the details of self-harm\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The user stopped themselves from acting\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe user has demonstrated a high level of severity in their thoughts and intentions (Q2 through Q5 are relevant), and while they did not ultimately act on their thoughts (Q6), their detailed planning and intention to harm themselves justify a severity rating of 5. The act of stopping themselves from carrying out the act is a critical factor that keeps the severity from being rated as 6."

The presence of \"I can't\" suggests some level of restraint or lack of intention to act due to the potential consequences on their family.\n   \"Q4\": \"The user expresses an initial desire to act but is conflicted, stating 'I can't' due to family implications.\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

However, there's no explicit indication of suicidal thoughts or actions beyond that. Therefore, the closest match is the first criteria."

The most relevant severity level based on the provided metrics is the first question, as it directly relates to wishing to be dead. However, the presence of a long history of suicidality elevates the concern.\n\nGiven the information and the criteria:\n- The individual has expressed a wish to die (\"wish to die and be at peace\"), which aligns with Severity: 1.\n- The acknowledgment of being suicidal for a long time aligns with Severity: 2.\n\nThe response in JSON format, based on the step-by-step analysis:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post expresses a wish to die.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The individual has a history of being suicidal.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThe chosen severity is 2 because the post directly indicates having had thoughts about killing themselves (suicidal for a very long time), which is a more severe indicator than just wishing to be dead. While there's no indication of a current plan or intention to act, the history of suicidality is a significant concern."

Thus, \"Q6\": The post implies action has been taken or is being taken.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the severity can be evaluated as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies the person has had thoughts about ending their life.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies intention to act on thoughts of ending their life.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post implies action has been taken or is being taken to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 6 because the post strongly implies that the person has taken or is in the process of taking action to end their life, as indicated by \"By the time you read this I'm gone.\" This directly corresponds to the criterion for Severity: 6."

Severity: 1**\nThe post expresses a deep emotional pain and longing for a past time or people, stating \"I beg to be free from this.\" This could be interpreted as wishing to escape their current suffering, which might imply a wish to not be alive or to not wake up. So, \"Q1\": \"The phrase 'I beg to be free from this' could imply a wish to escape their current suffering, potentially indicating a desire to not be alive or to not wake up.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post does not directly mention thoughts about killing themselves. It mentions missing various people and aspects of their past life and being in a state of significant emotional distress. So, \"Q2\": \"N/A\" because there's no direct indication of thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere is no mention or implication of considering methods to end their life. So, \"Q3\": \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nAs there's no indication of thoughts about killing themselves, there's also no indication of intending to act on such thoughts. So, \"Q4\": \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThe post does not indicate that they have started to work out or have worked out details of ending their life. So, \"Q5\": \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThere's no indication that they have taken any action or made preparations to end their life. So, \"Q6\": \"N/A\".\n\nGiven the information and expressions in the post, the closest match to the criteria is the first question due to the implication of wishing to be free from their current suffering. Although it's not a direct statement, it's the most relevant.\n\nTherefore, the severity rating is **1**, as it's the only criteria somewhat met by implication.\n\nThe response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The phrase 'I beg to be free from this' could imply a wish to escape their current suffering, potentially indicating a desire to not be alive or to not wake up.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```"

However, the context implies a death wish. Thus, the reasoning is: The post implies a death wish indirectly through the attempt. However, we directly mark N/A because it jumps directly to an attempt.\n\n   \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post indicates an actual attempt, which implies having had thoughts about killing oneself. Thus, the reasoning is: The post implies having had thoughts about killing oneself because of the attempt.\n\n   \"Q2\": Implied by the attempt\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post mentions \"partial hanging,\" which implies some thought about the method. Thus, the reasoning is: The specific method (partial hanging) indicates thinking about how to do it.\n\n   \"Q3\": Mention of \"partial hanging\" implies thought on the method\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The post indicates an attempt, showing both thought and intention. Thus, the reasoning is: The attempt to suicide (partial hanging) shows both thought and intention.\n\n   \"Q4\": The attempt demonstrates intention\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - The post implies working out or having worked out the details by mentioning \"partial hanging for 30+ minutes,\" indicating some planning or execution of a method. Thus, the reasoning is: The method and duration indicate some level of planning or detail.\n\n   \"Q5\": Implied by the detail of the method and duration\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post explicitly states an attempt (\"I attempted... I tried partial hanging\"), showing that the person has done something to end their life. Thus, the reasoning is: The post directly states an attempt to end life.\n\n   \"Q6\": Directly states an attempt\n\nGiven the analysis, the severity should be evaluated based on the highest criteria met. Since the post directly mentions an attempt (\"I tried partial hanging\"), it fulfills the criteria for Severity: 6.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": \"Implied by the attempt\",\n  \"Q3\": \"Mention of 'partial hanging' implies thought on the method\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The attempt demonstrates intention\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Implied by the detail of the method and duration\",\n  \"Q6\": \"Directly states an attempt\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```"

Thus, **\"Q3\": \"The user engaged in self-harm (banging head against the floor), but it's not clear if this was with the intent to end their life or not.\"**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe act of banging their head against the floor could indicate some level of intention to harm themselves, but it's not clear if this was intended as a suicidal act. The overall tone suggests frustration and self-loathing rather than a clear suicidal intent. Thus, **\"Q4\": \"The user's actions (banging head against the floor) could suggest some level of intent to harm themselves, but the context is more about frustration and less about a clear suicidal plan.\"**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\nThere's no indication that the user has worked out or is working out the details of a suicide plan. Thus, **\"Q5\": \"N/A\"**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThe user mentions banging their head against the floor, which is a form of self-harm. While this is a concerning behavior, it's not explicitly stated to be an attempt to end their life. Thus, **\"Q6\": \"The user has engaged in self-harm (banging head against the floor), which could be seen as a harmful action, but it's not clear if it was intended to end their life.\"**\n\nGiven these observations, the post's severity is high due to the explicit wish not to be alive (\"I just want to be gone\"), the mention of self-harm (\"bang my head against the floor\"), and the overall tone of despair and frustration. The closest matching severity based on the provided metrics would be related to having wished to be dead or not wake up (Severity: 1) and the presence of self-harm actions which might not directly align with the higher severity questions but indicates significant distress.\n\nThe overall severity is considered **\"severity\": 2** because the user has expressed thoughts about not wanting to be alive and has engaged in self-harm, but there's no clear indication of a detailed plan or intent to carry out suicide.\n\nHere is the response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a wish not to be alive or present.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The language is not direct, but the sentiment implies a strong desire not to be alive, which could be interpreted as having thoughts about ending one's life.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user engaged in self-harm (banging head against the floor), but it's not clear if this was with the intent to end their life or not.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user's actions (banging head against the floor) could suggest some level of intent to harm themselves, but the context is more about frustration and less about a clear suicidal plan.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The user has engaged in self-harm (banging head against the floor), which could be seen as a harmful action, but it's not clear if it was intended to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

It talks about facing \"demons and insecurities,\" which could imply emotional distress but does not directly fulfill the criteria for Severity 1. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" (Severity: 2)\nThe post does not mention having thoughts about killing oneself. It is seeking support regarding struggles with polyamory, indicating a need to discuss emotional or relational challenges. Hence, \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" (Severity: 3)\nThere's no indication in the post that the individual is considering methods of suicide. The language used focuses on the emotional struggle rather than suicidal ideation or planning. So, \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" (Severity: 4)\nThe post doesn't suggest that the individual has thoughts of suicide or any intention to act on such thoughts. It seeks support from experienced polyamorous individuals, implying a desire to address or understand their emotional struggles. Thus, \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" (Severity: 5)\nThe post is devoid of any mention or implication of planning or intending to carry out suicide. The focus is on seeking support for dealing with personal insecurities and emotional challenges. Therefore, \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" (Severity: 6)\nThere's no indication that the individual has taken, is taking, or is preparing to take any action to end their life. The post is a call for support regarding the challenges of being polyamorous. So, \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven the analysis, the post does not directly or indirectly indicate any level of suicidal ideation or behavior as per the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics. The individual is seeking support for emotional struggles related to polyamory. While the post suggests emotional distress, it does not fulfill the criteria for any of the severity levels.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 0 because the post is not related to suicide; it's about seeking support for personal struggles related to polyamory."

So, this criteria is technically fulfilled but is far exceeded by the content of the post. Thus, the post is more severe than this category. **Q1: N/A but implicit**\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The action described (overdosing) implies that there were thoughts about killing oneself. Thus, **Q2: Fulfilled as the person has overdosed, indicating thoughts about killing themselves were acted upon.**\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The fact that the person overdosed on a specific quantity of tablets implies they had considered how to do it. **Q3: Fulfilled as the method was considered and executed.**\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The action taken (overdosing) shows that there was an intention to act on the thoughts. **Q4: Fulfilled as there was clear intention.**\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - The person has not only thought about it but has taken a significant action (overdosing on 49 tablets of 500mg Panadol), indicating they had worked out the details (obtaining and consuming the tablets) and intended to carry out the plan. **Q5: Fulfilled as they worked out and carried out the plan.**\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post clearly states that the person has overdosed, which means they have done something to end their life. **Q6: Fulfilled as they have done something to end their life (overdosed).**\n\nGiven the information in the post, the severity is directly related to the action taken (overdosing), which is a direct attempt to end one's life. \n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A but implicit\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Fulfilled as the person has overdosed, indicating thoughts about killing themselves were acted upon.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"Fulfilled as the method was considered and executed.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"Fulfilled as there was clear intention.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Fulfilled as they worked out and carried out the plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"Fulfilled as they have done something to end their life (overdosed).\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 6 because the person has done something to end their life by overdosing on a significant quantity of medication, directly corresponding to the criteria for the highest severity level."

Severity: 5**\nThe individual has researched the lethal dose of their prescribed medication, Aripiprasole (correct spelling), indicating they have worked out some details. The phrase \"Why not?\" could imply an intention, but there's no clear indication they have a definitive plan to carry it out.\n\"Q5\": \"The post indicates working out some details by researching the lethal dose but doesn't clearly state a definitive plan or intention to carry it out.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?

The user mentions they \"tried to kill myself\" about a year ago. This directly relates to question 6, as it indicates they have done something to end their life in the past.\n\n2. The user states they are \"much better now and am not suicidal neither am I depressed,\" indicating a current state that doesn't align with the higher severity questions.\n\nLet's break down the questions:\n\n- \"Q1: Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?\" \nThe post doesn't directly mention current wishes to be dead or to sleep and not wake up, so it's N/A for current state but indicates past severity.\n\n- \"Q2: Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" \nThe post doesn't directly address current thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n- \"Q3: Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" \nThere's no indication in the post that they are currently thinking about how to kill themselves.\n\n- \"Q4: Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" \nThe post doesn't indicate current intention.\n\n- \"Q5: Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The post is seeking help understanding their current feelings about a past event rather than expressing current suicidal ideation or intent. Therefore, it does not align with the severity scale's higher ratings that pertain to current suicidal thoughts or actions."

Thus, it fulfills a more severe criterion, but to directly answer this question: the sentiment is implied, so \"wished you were dead\" is relevant, but not directly assessed. However, it's clear the individual is beyond just wishing.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** \n   - The post directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself (\"i can't take it anymore idk how to just die\"), so it's reasonable to infer that the individual has had such thoughts.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?** \n   - The individual has not explicitly mentioned thinking about how to kill themselves before acting, but the act of trying to swallow pills indicates some consideration or knowledge of a method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?** \n   - The post clearly indicates an intention and action (\"I just tried to swallow a bunch of pills\"), showing that there was both a thought and an intention.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?** \n   - The individual took an action (swallowing pills), indicating some level of having worked out a method or knowing a method to end their life. The intention is also clear.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?** \n   - The statement directly confirms this (\"I just tried to swallow a bunch of pills\"), showing that an action was taken.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- **Q1**: The post implies the individual wished they were dead or had similar feelings, but it directly shows they went beyond that stage (\"i can't take it anymore\"). So, it's somewhat relevant but not directly answered; the severity is beyond this initial level. **N/A** directly, but implied yes.\n- **Q2**: The individual has had thoughts about killing themselves (\"idk how to just die\"). **Yes**\n- **Q3**: The action taken (swallowing pills) suggests they had considered a method. **Yes**\n- **Q4**: The individual had thoughts and an intention to act (\"I just tried to swallow a bunch of pills\"). **Yes**\n- **Q5**: The action taken (swallowing pills) shows some level of having worked out a method and intending to carry it out. **Yes**\n- **Q6**: The individual has done something to end their life (swallowing pills). **Yes**\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A (implied yes, but beyond this level)\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Yes, had thoughts about killing themselves\",\n  \"Q3\": \"Yes, considered a method\",\n  \"Q4\": \"Yes, had thoughts and intention to act\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Yes, worked out a method and intended to carry it out\",\n  \"Q6\": \"Yes, took an action to end their life\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is **6**, as the individual has taken a concrete action towards ending their life by swallowing pills, directly corresponding to Q6."

However, the emotional distress is significant. \"Q1\": The user hasn't directly expressed a wish to be dead, but the pain and isolation could imply such feelings indirectly.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"  \nThe post doesn't directly mention thoughts of killing oneself but mentions \"clawing at myself,\" which indicates self-harm. \"Q2\": There's no direct mention of thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"  \nThere's no explicit or implicit mention of thinking about how to kill oneself. \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"  \nThe post does not directly indicate having thoughts about killing oneself or the intention to act on them. \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The mention of self-harm aligns more closely with a severe level of distress but doesn't directly answer the questions regarding suicidal ideation or intent.\n\nGiven the information:\n- \"Q1\": The post implies a deep emotional pain and isolation, which might indirectly suggest a wish to escape their suffering, so it's plausible the user has wished they could escape their pain.\n- \"Q2\": N/A\n- \"Q3\": N/A\n- \"Q4\": N/A\n- \"Q5\": N/A\n- \"Q6\": The user has engaged in self-harm.\n\nSince the user has engaged in self-harm (\"clawing at myself\"), which is a dangerous behavior, we should take this into consideration. However, according to the scale provided, the severity is more directly related to suicidal ideation and intent.\n\nThe closest match based on the provided scale and the information given would be to rate the severity based on the presence of significant emotional distress and self-harm behavior, which doesn't directly fit the scale's criteria for suicidal ideation.\n\nResponse in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user is expressing deep emotional pain and isolation.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The user has engaged in self-harm ('clawing at myself'), which is a dangerous behavior.\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe assigned severity is 1 because the user hasn't directly expressed suicidal ideation but is expressing a significant level of emotional distress and has engaged in self-harm. The scale prioritizes direct expressions of suicidal ideation or intent, and while the user's situation is dire and warrants concern, it doesn't directly fit into the higher severity categories based on the information provided."

So, the condition is met but not directly; however, it's not the most relevant to this specific question. Thus, we can mark it as N/A for this specific criteria, but we note the presence of more severe indicators.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** (Severity: 2)\n   - The post mentions \"bad thoughts\" and an attempt 10 days ago, suggesting that the individual has had thoughts about killing themselves. Thus, \"Q2\": The post implies having thoughts about killing themselves due to mentioning \"bad thoughts\" and a past attempt.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** (Severity: 3)\n   - The post doesn't directly state that they have been thinking about how to kill themselves, but given the context of a recent attempt and current distress, it's plausible. However, there's no explicit mention. So, \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no direct evidence.\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** (Severity: 4)\n   - The individual states, \"I don't want to attempt again,\" implying they have had thoughts and possibly some intention. The context suggests they are struggling with acting on these thoughts. Thus, \"Q4\": The post implies having thoughts and some level of intention is present, given the recent attempt and current distress.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"** (Severity: 5)\n   - The post doesn't explicitly mention working out the details of a plan. So, \"Q5\": N/A.\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"** (Severity: 6)\n   - The individual mentions a suicide attempt 10 days ago but doesn't indicate any current preparation or action towards ending their life.

This matches the criteria for Severity: 4, \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\""

        "llama_response": "To evaluate the given post according to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics, let's break down the content step by step.\n\n1. **Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?** The user expresses a desire to not \"keep living like this,\" indicating a wish to escape their current state of suffering, which aligns with wishing they were dead or could go to sleep and not wake up. Thus, \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a desire to not 'keep living like this'.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** The user mentions \"I guess mine too\" when referring to seeing others post their endings, implying they are considering their own ending. This suggests they have had thoughts about killing themselves. Thus, \"Q2\": \"The user implies consideration of their own ending.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?** The post does not directly state that the user has been thinking about the method, but it implies a level of consideration by stating \"I have the courage to do it.\" Thus, \"Q3\": \"The user mentions having the courage to do it, implying consideration of the act.\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?** The user indicates an intention by saying \"I guess not anymore\" after mentioning the thought of their friends and family grieving holding them back. This implies they had intentions before. Thus, \"Q4\": \"The user indicates previous intention to act.\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?** The post does not explicitly mention working out the details, but the statement \"I guess not anymore\" suggests a shift in their resolve, implying some level of planning or consideration. However, the details are not provided. Thus, \"Q5\": \"N/A, as the post doesn't explicitly state working out the details.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?** The post does not explicitly state that the user has taken any action towards ending their life. Thus, \"Q6\": \"N/A, as there's no explicit mention of taking action.\"\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The user wished they were dead or wanted to escape their suffering (Q1).\n- They had thoughts about killing themselves (Q2).\n- They implied consideration of the act (Q3).\n- They had intentions to act on these thoughts (Q4).\n\nThe user's statement \"I guess not anymore\" after being held back by the thought of their loved ones grieving, followed by \"see you on the other side,\" is a critical indicator of their resolve. Although it doesn't directly state they've taken action or made a plan, the language used is concerning and indicates a strong intention.\n\nTherefore, the severity is best categorized under having had thoughts and some intention of acting on them, but leaning towards a higher severity due to the explicit mention of having the courage and the final farewell.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a desire to not 'keep living like this'.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user implies consideration of their own ending.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user mentions having the courage to do it, implying consideration of the act.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user indicates previous intention to act.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A, as the post doesn't explicitly state working out the details.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A, as there's no explicit mention of taking action.\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```\n\nHowever, considering the overall context and the final statement \"see you on the other side,\" which could be interpreted as a very strong intention or a step towards action, one might argue for a higher severity. The exact action or preparation isn't stated, but the language is very concerning.\n\nThus, while the analysis directly supports a severity of 4 based on the provided criteria, the overall tone and final statement might suggest a closer examination is needed, potentially leaning towards a severity of 5 or 6 if more context or explicit statements about planning or preparation were available.\n\nFor the given data and sticking strictly to the criteria and information provided:\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a desire to not 'keep living like this'.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user implies consideration of their own ending.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user mentions having the courage to do it, implying consideration of the act.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user indicates previous intention to act.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A, as the post doesn't explicitly state working out the details.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A, as there's no explicit mention of taking action.\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

However, the initial part of the statement directly relates to having thoughts about killing oneself. So, while it implies a stronger sentiment than just wishing to be dead, **Q1 is N/A** because it directly indicates a more severe condition.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The post explicitly states \"I wanna kms,\" which directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself. Therefore, **Q2: The post explicitly mentions a desire to kill oneself**.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The post doesn't explicitly discuss methods of suicide or thinking about how to do it. Hence, **Q3 is N/A**.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The statement \"I wanna kms\" indicates having thoughts about killing oneself and implies a certain level of intent or desire. Therefore, **Q4: The willingness to kms implies some intention**.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - There's no mention of working out the details of a suicide plan in the post. So, **Q5 is N/A**.\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post doesn't indicate that the individual has taken any steps or made preparations to end their life. Hence, **Q6 is N/A**.\n\nGiven the information and the explicit desire to kill oneself (\"I wanna kms\") along with an implication of having some intention due to the expressed desire, the severity can be evaluated.\n\nThe JSON response based on the evaluation is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post explicitly mentions a desire to kill oneself\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The willingness to kms implies some intention\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 4 because the post indicates having thoughts about killing oneself and implies some intention of acting on them (\"I wanna kms\"), but it doesn't provide evidence of having worked out the details of the plan or having taken any actions towards ending their life."

Thus, \"Q1\": \"The user expresses being 'done with life', indicating a wish to not be alive.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe user explicitly states, \"I REALLY want to kms\" (kms is a slang abbreviation for \"kill myself\"), indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves. Thus, \"Q2\": \"The user explicitly expresses a desire to kill themselves.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThe post mentions, \"I have multiple plans,\" which directly indicates that the user has been thinking about how to kill themselves. Thus, \"Q3\": \"The user mentions having multiple plans, showing they have thought about the method.\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nGiven the user attempted suicide \"like, 3 days ago,\" it's clear they had the intention to act on their thoughts. Thus, \"Q4\": \"The user had an intention to act on their thoughts as evidenced by a recent attempt.\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\nThe user states they \"have multiple plans,\" indicating they have worked out details. They also mention a recent attempt, showing intent. Thus, \"Q5\": \"The user had worked out the details and had intended to carry out the plan, as shown by their recent attempt.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThe post reveals, \"I attempted like, 3 days ago,\" which means the user has done something to end their life.

The age of the user (12 years old) and the explicit mention of a recent attempt further emphasize the severity of the situation."

Thus, **\"Q1\": \"The statement implies a wish to die, fulfilling this criterion.\"**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\n   The post explicitly mentions, \"I think about suicide everyday.\" This directly indicates having thoughts about killing oneself. Thus, **\"Q2\": \"The explicit mention of thinking about suicide fulfills this criterion.\"**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   The post does not specify any thoughts on the method of suicide. Thus, **\"Q3\": \"N/A\"** because there's no information provided about thinking about how to kill oneself.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\n   While the post expresses thoughts of suicide, it doesn't directly state an intention to act on them. However, the overall tone and the statement \"I feel like my mind wants me to die\" could imply some level of intention or a strong desire. The explicit fear of talking to anybody might suggest a level of desperation. Thus, **\"Q4\": \"The overall tone and feeling of being consumed by misery and suicidal thoughts could imply some intention, but it's not explicit.\"**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\n   There's no indication in the post that the individual has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan.

Severity:6**\n   The post does not indicate any action or preparation to end life. Thus, **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"** because there's no information that suggests any preparatory actions towards suicide.\n\nGiven the analysis, the post clearly indicates having wished to be dead or not wake up (Q1) and having thoughts about killing oneself (Q2). The severity level is at least a 2 because of the explicit mention of thinking about suicide daily.\n\nThe JSON response based on the analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The statement implies a wish to die, fulfilling this criterion.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The explicit mention of thinking about suicide fulfills this criterion.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The overall tone and feeling of being consumed by misery and suicidal thoughts could imply some intention, but it's not explicit.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThe assigned severity is **2**, as the post directly indicates thoughts about killing oneself, which aligns with the second question of the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. While there's an implication of a strong desire or wish to die and some level of desperation, there's no explicit indication of planning or preparing to act on these thoughts."

However, it doesn't directly fulfill the criteria for wishing to be dead.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post doesn't directly mention thoughts about killing himself but expresses a sense of hopelessness regarding the future (\"I see nothing but darkness in humanity's future\"). It doesn't explicitly fulfill the criteria.\n   - \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - There's no indication in the post that the individual has been thinking about how to kill themselves. The focus is more on the emotional and psychological state and the search for help or suggestions.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The post doesn't explicitly mention having thoughts about killing himself or any intention to act on such thoughts. It seeks \"suggestions,\" implying a search for alternatives or help.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - There's no mention or implication of working out details of a suicide plan or intending to carry it out.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post doesn't indicate any action or preparation towards ending his life. Instead, it reaches out for \"suggestions,\" indicating an openness to finding alternative solutions.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A\n\nThe individual expresses severe distress and hopelessness, mentioning that therapy and medications haven't helped. While the post indicates a significant level of emotional pain and a sense of being overwhelmed, it does not directly fulfill any of the specific criteria for severity levels 1 through 6 as per the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE.\n\nThe post is related to suicidal ideation indirectly by mentioning being pushed \"over the edge\" and a pervasive sense of darkness and hopelessness. However, it directly asks for \"suggestions,\" indicating a desire for help or alternative solutions rather than explicitly expressing suicidal thoughts or plans.\n\nGiven this analysis, while there's an underlying distress that could be related to suicidal thoughts, the post doesn't directly fulfill the criteria for any of the severity levels. The most relevant interpretation is that the individual is seeking help, which is a critical factor in assessing the severity.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the fact that the post is seeking suggestions (implying a search for help), the severity is not directly aligned with the higher levels of the scale. However, the expression of severe distress and the feeling of being overwhelmed suggests a level of severity.\n\nThe response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning for assigning a severity of 1 is based on the implicit expression of distress and hopelessness that could be interpreted as wishing to escape their current state, even though it's not directly stated as wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up. The individual's reaching out for help (\"Any suggestions?\") is a crucial factor, indicating a desire to find alternatives and potentially mitigating the severity."

The user feels awful and mentions someone told them to kill themselves. They express their mental state is at its breaking point and state they will kill themselves tomorrow. While the initial part doesn't directly indicate wishing to be dead, the overall context and the statement about killing themselves tomorrow implies a stronger severity than just wishing to be dead. However, to directly answer Q1, we can infer that the user has wished they were dead or wished to not wake up because they mention a terrible day and feeling awful, which could imply such wishes.

So, \"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\n   The post does not explicitly mention any actions taken or preparations made towards ending their life. So, \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nGiven the explicit statement of intending to kill themselves tomorrow (\"Tomorow i'm going to kill myself\"), the severity is high. Although the details of the plan are not mentioned, the clear intention and statement of when they plan to act on it (\"Tomorow\") brings the severity to a high level.\n\nThe JSON response based on the analysis is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user is having a terrible day and feels awful, implying a wish to escape their situation.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user explicitly states their intention to kill themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user has expressed a clear intention to act on their thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 4 because the user has had thoughts about killing themselves and has expressed a clear intention to act on them, as indicated by their statement of killing themselves tomorrow. While the criteria for severity levels 5 and 6 are not directly met due to the lack of explicit details about planning or taking actions towards ending their life, the explicit intention to act (\"Tomorow i'm going to kill myself\") aligns with a severity level of 4."

        "llama_response": "To evaluate the given post step by step using the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics and assign a severity score, let's analyze the post: \"Curious Has anyone tried drinking rubbing alcohol?\"\n\n1. **Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? Severity:1**\n   - The post does not directly or indirectly express a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. It is a question about drinking rubbing alcohol, which could be interpreted as seeking information on a potentially harmful behavior, but it doesn't directly relate to wishing to be dead. So, \"N/A\" for this criterion because the context doesn't directly imply a death wish.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\n   - The post doesn't explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself. While drinking rubbing alcohol can be harmful and potentially life-threatening, the question is framed as curiosity rather than an expression of suicidal ideation. Thus, \"N/A\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   - The act of drinking rubbing alcohol could be considered a method to harm oneself, but the post is inquiring if anyone has tried it, not explicitly stating it as a method for suicide. So, it could be seen as potentially related but not directly indicative of planning suicide. Hence, \"N/A\" because the context is more about curiosity than a clear suicidal intent.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\n   - There's no clear indication that the person has thoughts of killing themselves or intends to act on such thoughts by drinking rubbing alcohol or any other means. The question seems to be about the experience of others rather than a declaration of intent. So, \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\n   - The post doesn't indicate that the person has started to work out or has worked out details of a suicide plan. The inquiry about drinking rubbing alcohol doesn't directly suggest planning or intending to carry out a suicide plan. Thus, \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\n   - The post doesn't suggest that the person has taken, started, or prepared to take any action to end their life. It's a question, not a statement of action or preparation. So, \"N/A\".\n\nGiven the analysis, the post's severity is not directly related to the explicit criteria of suicidal ideation or behavior as defined by the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. However, it raises concern due to its reference to a harmful behavior (drinking rubbing alcohol), which can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening.\n\nThe JSON response based on the analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 0 because, upon careful examination, the post doesn't directly relate to the metrics provided for assessing suicidal ideation or behavior. While the post is concerning due to its reference to a dangerous behavior, it doesn't fit into the scale's criteria for suicidal severity."

It mentions \"sick actions\" and a need for context, but there's no clear indication of wishing death upon oneself. So, \"Q1\": N/A.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\n   There's no explicit mention of thoughts about killing oneself. The post refers to \"sick actions\" but doesn't specify them as being suicidal. Thus, \"Q2\": N/A.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   The post does not indicate thinking about methods of suicide. The focus is on needing help to understand past actions. Hence, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   There is no clear indication of having thoughts about suicide or any intention to act on such thoughts.

Severity: 6**\n   There's no indication of having done, started, or prepared anything to end one's life. Thus, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nGiven the information and the analysis, the post's primary concern seems to be about seeking help and context for \"sick actions\" without directly indicating suicidal ideation or behavior as defined by the scale. However, it's crucial to take any mention of \"sick actions\" seriously and consider the context. The post implies a need for support, which could be related to various issues, not necessarily suicidal.\n\nSince there's no direct reference to suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions according to the provided scale, the severity is rated based on the absence of explicit suicidal content.\n\nThe JSON response based on the given template is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation is based on the explicit content of the post and the metrics provided by the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. It's essential to approach such posts with sensitivity and consider seeking professional help for the individual expressing distress."

However, the statement can imply a severe form of wishing not to be alive anymore due to the struggles. So, \"Q1\": \"Implied, as the person is considering ending their life due to debt struggles.\"\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** (Severity: 2)\n   - The post explicitly mentions, \"I am thinking to end my life,\" which directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself. Thus, \"Q2\": \"Yes, the person is thinking about ending their life.\"\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** (Severity: 3)\n   - The post does not specify any details about how the person might end their life.

However, it does not directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. Thus, it's not a clear fulfillment of this criterion, but it hints at a strong negative feeling towards life.\n\n   \"Q1\": \"The statement 'I hate this life' implies a strong dissatisfaction with life, which could be related to wishing to be dead or not wake up, but it's not a direct statement.\"\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The text does not directly mention thoughts about killing oneself. However, the overall tone and the expression of intense emotional pain and feeling overwhelmed could imply suicidal ideation.\n\n   \"Q2\": \"N/A, as there's no direct mention of thoughts about killing oneself.\"\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - There's no mention or implication of thinking about methods of suicide.\n\n   \"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - Again, there's no direct indication of having thoughts about suicide or intending to act on them.\n\n   \"Q4\": \"N/A\"\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The sentence \"If I was left by myself, I could wither away into nothing\" is more about feeling disconnected and not having the energy to continue rather than an active step towards ending life.\n\n   \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nThe overall severity is determined by the most severe question that is applicable. The closest relevant statement is \"Q1\" due to the expression of intense dissatisfaction with life (\"I hate this life\"), but it does not directly fulfill the criteria for wishing to be dead or to sleep and not wake up.\n\nGiven the information and the closest match:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The statement 'I hate this life' implies a strong dissatisfaction with life, which could be related to wishing to be dead or not wake up, but it's not a direct statement.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 1 because the post implies a strong negative feeling towards life, which is the closest match to the first criterion, even though it's not a direct fulfillment. The absence of direct references to suicidal thoughts or actions in the subsequent criteria means that the severity does not escalate beyond 1."

Severity: 1**\n   - The post \"Help I'm lost\" does not directly or indirectly express a wish to be dead or to go to sleep and not wake up.

The closest matching criteria directly supported by the text is Severity: 1, and with some interpretation, Severity: 2. However, the expression of feeling worthless, not enjoying anything, and not wanting to be there strongly suggests a significant level of distress. The severity is thus kept at 2 due to the implication of suicidal ideation without clear evidence of planning or intent."

The user's expression of feeling meaningless and stating they've been debating suicide every day aligns with questions 1 and 2. The lack of explicit details on methods or preparations for suicide means that questions 3, 5, and 6 are not directly fulfilled. However, the user's expressed intention to potentially act due to their unbearable current state aligns with question 4, thus warranting a severity rating of 4."

The statement \"I'm just so tired of it all\" and the mention of suicide being on their mind daily can be seen as indirectly wishing to escape their current state. Thus, \"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish to escape their current life situation, suggesting a possible wish to not be alive or to stop their suffering.\"\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The post directly mentions that \"suicide has been on my mind everyday\" and has been particularly bad over the past week. This indicates that the person has had thoughts about killing themselves. Thus, \"Q2\": \"The post directly mentions having thoughts about suicide.\"\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - There's no direct mention or implication of planning or thinking about how to kill themselves in the post. Thus, \"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The act of self-sabotaging a relationship could be seen as a form of self-destructive behavior or a cry for help, but it doesn't directly indicate an intention to act on suicidal thoughts. However, the overall context suggests a significant level of distress. Thus, \"Q4\": \"N/A directly, but self-sabotaging behavior might imply some level of self-destructive intent.\"\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - There's no indication in the post that the person has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan. Thus, \"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post does not indicate any specific actions taken or preparations made to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The post directly indicates having suicidal thoughts (Q2), fulfilling the criteria for Severity: 2.\n- There's an implication of wishing to escape their life situation (Q1), but the direct mention of suicidal thoughts takes precedence.\n\nThe severity should be evaluated based on the most severe criterion met. Here, the most severe criterion directly met is having thoughts about killing themselves.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish to escape their current life situation, suggesting a possible wish to not be alive or to stop their suffering.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post directly mentions having thoughts about suicide.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A directly, but self-sabotaging behavior might imply some level of self-destructive intent.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

However, the context implies a possible self-harm or suicidal attempt (\"I tried, but I failed\", \"I think I didn't tie it tightly enough\"). So, it's not directly related to this question, but there's an implication of a more severe issue. Thus, \"N/A\" for this specific question but will be considered in the overall context.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** Severity: 2\nThe post implies a past action that could be related to self-harm or suicide (\"I tried\"), but it doesn't directly state having thoughts about killing oneself. The implication is strong that there was an attempt or action taken, but the thought process behind it isn't explicitly mentioned. So, \"N/A\" but potentially related.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** Severity: 3\nThe post suggests an action was taken (\"I tried\"), and there's a mention of not doing something correctly (\"I didn't tie it tightly enough\"), which implies some method or plan was considered or attempted. However, it doesn't directly state that there were thoughts about how to do it. Thus, \"N/A\" but again, potentially related due to the implication of a method.\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** Severity: 4\nThe post implies an action was taken (\"I tried\"), suggesting there was an intention. The fact that the person \"tried\" and mentions a possible failure in the method (\"didn't tie it tightly enough\") implies intention behind the action. So, this could be seen as related, and the reasoning that fulfills this criterion is the implication of an attempt and a mentioned failure in the method.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"** Severity: 5\nThe post implies working out or having a plan (\"I think I didn't tie it tightly enough\"), suggesting some level of detail was considered or attempted. The mention of an action taken and a reflection on its failure implies intention. Thus, \"The post implies a level of planning and intention.\"\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"** Severity: 6\nThe post clearly states, \"I tried,\" and describes an incident that could be related to attempting to end one's life (\"I found myself on the ground\", \"I couldn't breathe\", \"I lost consciousness\"). The mention of \"I think I didn't tie it tightly enough\" strongly suggests an action was taken. Therefore, \"The post directly implies an action was taken to end one's life.\"\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies an attempt and a mentioned failure in the method, suggesting intention.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post implies a level of planning and intention.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post directly implies an action was taken to end one's life.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 6 because the post directly implies that an action was taken to end one's life, aligning with the criteria for Severity: 6."

However, the individual is expressing fear about their current situation due to substance use and is feeling \"really down.\" So, while not directly fulfilling this criterion, there's an underlying negative emotional state.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The post explicitly states it's \"not really a suicide post,\" indicating the individual does not have explicit suicidal thoughts.\n   - \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   There's no indication that the individual is thinking about methods to end their life. The concern is about the potential consequences of their substance use rather than a desire to end their life.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   The post does not suggest any intention to act on suicidal thoughts. The user's concern is about the accidental overdose rather than a deliberate act.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The individual's state is more related to accidental overdose risk rather than a deliberate act to end their life.\n\nGiven this analysis, the post is more about the fear of accidental overdose rather than suicidal intent. However, the fear of having potentially taken a harmful amount of substance could be interpreted as a severe concern.\n\nThe response in JSON format, based on the given template:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nJustification: The post is not directly related to suicidal ideation or intent as per the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. While it involves a serious concern (fear of overdose), the context is about accidental overdose rather than a deliberate act to end one's life. Hence, it is rated as 0 for severity according to the given scale, as it doesn't directly fulfill any of the criteria for suicidal severity. However, it is worth noting that the situation described is risky and warrants concern and potentially a response related to accidental overdose or substance misuse."

Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" \nThere's no mention of working out the details of a plan to kill themselves.\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" \nWhile there's a strong expression of suicidal intent, there's no indication that they've taken or prepared to take any action towards ending their life.\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nGiven the information in the post, the highest severity level directly supported is \"2\" because the user explicitly states having thoughts about killing themselves. However, their expression of intent and desperation might suggest a higher severity. The user's statement of \"i just need to get through the night\" and seeking help (\"i need help\", \"i'll prob take therapy\") suggests they are looking for support, which complicates the assessment.\n\nThe severity should be determined based on the most severe criterion that is met. The user has explicitly had thoughts about killing themselves (Severity: 2), and there's an implication of some intention (Severity: 4), although the latter isn't directly stated with a clear plan or action.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate severity level based on the given information is 2 because that's the highest level where we have a clear indication (\"i want to fucking kill myself\"). However, considering the context and the immediate intent implied, one might argue it leans towards a higher severity due to the expressed emotional state and the explicit desire to die.\n\nThe JSON response based on the above analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user explicitly expresses a wish to be dead.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user explicitly states a desire to kill themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user's expression of a desire to kill themselves and their current state of distress implies some intention.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nHowever, given the context, a clinician might consider the severity to be higher due to the overall distress and explicit suicidal ideation. The provided scale and response format lead to a severity rating of 2 based on direct answers, but clinical judgment might adjust this based on the overall context and other factors not directly captured by the scale."

However, there's no direct mention or implication of thoughts about killing themselves. Thus, the reasoning for this criterion is N/A.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   Since there's no indication in the post that the author has had thoughts about killing themselves, it follows that there's also no indication they've been thinking about how to do it. Therefore, the reasoning is N/A.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   The post doesn't mention any suicidal thoughts or intentions, so it's not applicable. The reasoning is N/A.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\n   As there's no mention of suicidal thoughts or planning, the reasoning is N/A.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\n   The post doesn't indicate any actions or preparations towards ending their life. Hence, the reasoning is N/A.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the post does not directly relate to suicidal thoughts or actions as per the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics.\n\nThe JSON response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis is because the post does not explicitly or implicitly indicate any suicidal ideation or behavior, thus it's rated as 0, meaning it's not related to suicide according to the provided scale."

However, it doesn't directly indicate any specific plan or action towards suicide.\n\nGiven this analysis, the severity is rated as 1 because the post implies a wish not to be alive due to feeling worthless and not deserving to live, but it does not directly indicate any thoughts of killing oneself or further actions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The statement implies a deep self-worth issue and a feeling of not deserving to live, which can be linked to wishing not to be alive.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```"

Thus, \"Q1\": The post fulfills this criterion as it directly expresses a wish to die.\n\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The statement \"I'm about to jump off a high bridge\" indicates a clear thought about killing oneself. Thus, \"Q2\": The post fulfills this criterion.\n\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - Jumping off a high bridge is a specific method, indicating that the person has thought about how to end their life. Thus, \"Q3\": The post fulfills this criterion.\n\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The phrase \"I'm about to\" indicates a clear intention to act on the thoughts of killing oneself. Thus, \"Q4\": The post fulfills this criterion.\n\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - By stating they are \"about to jump,\" it suggests that the details have been implicitly considered, and there's an intention to carry out the plan. Thus, \"Q5\": The post fulfills this criterion.\n\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The statement implies an immediate action is about to be taken (\"I'm about to jump\"), suggesting preparation or readiness to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": The post fulfills this criterion.\n\n\nGiven the analysis, the JSON response is:\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post directly expresses a wish to die.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post indicates a clear thought about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post indicates a specific method of suicide.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post indicates a clear intention to act on suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post implies that the person intends to carry out their suicidal plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post implies an immediate action to end their life is about to be taken.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\nThis post is evaluated at the highest severity level (6) because it indicates an immediate intention to act on suicidal thoughts with a clear plan."

I want to cut everywhere,\" which indicates thoughts about harming themselves. While this is not a direct method of killing themselves, it shows a consideration of self-harm, which can be related to the broader context of thinking about how to end their life or causing harm to oneself.\n   - \"Q3\": The post expresses thoughts about self-harm.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   The user explicitly states \"I don't want help anymore,\" and expresses multiple desires to harm themselves or not be alive, indicating a certain level of intention or desire to act on these thoughts, even though it's not a direct statement of intent to act on suicidal thoughts.\n   - \"Q4\": The post implies an intention or strong desire related to self-harm and not wanting to be alive.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The direct expression of wishing to die and thoughts about killing oneself places it at least at a Severity: 2. The expressed desire to harm themselves significantly (\"cut off my genitals, cut off my breasts, cut everywhere\") and not wanting help anymore suggests a higher level of distress and potential intent, aligning more closely with Severity: 4 due to the implied intention behind their statements and the clear expression of not wanting to be alive or in their current situation.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post expresses a wish to die in their sleep.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies thoughts about killing themselves by expressing a desire to 'die in my sleep.'\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post expresses thoughts about self-harm.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies an intention or strong desire related to self-harm and not wanting to be alive.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

The presence of a significant reason to continue living (their child) is also noted. The closest match is the expression of wishing they were in a different state or not alive (\"Only living from obligation\"), aligning with Severity:1. However, the overall context and the explicit mentioning of not wanting to continue living due to various struggles elevate the concern.\n\nGiven the information and analysis, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a sense of living out of obligation and feeling stuck, implying a wish for a different state of being.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user mentions reasons they don't want to continue living and expresses hopelessness, suggesting they have had thoughts about ending their life, though it's not directly stated.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 2 because, while the post does not directly state suicidal thoughts or plans, it implies a significant level of distress and despair, suggesting the presence of thoughts about killing oneself, even if not explicitly stated."

However, it can be inferred that the individual has had such wishes.\n   - \"Q1\": The post implies the presence of suicidal thoughts, suggesting wishes to be dead or not wake up could be underlying.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The post explicitly states, \"I was suicidal,\" indicating the presence of thoughts about killing oneself.\n   - \"Q2\": The user explicitly mentions being suicidal.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   There's no direct mention of planning or thinking about how to kill themselves. The post focuses on the emotional state and past actions rather than current plans.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no explicit mention of thinking about the method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   The user mentions being suicidal and having self-harmed, indicating some level of intention or action related to their suicidal thoughts. However, the intention to act is not explicitly stated in the present tense.\n   - \"Q4\": The post implies past intention or action through self-harm but does not clearly state current intention.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   There's no mention of working out the details of a suicide plan.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no mention of planning.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   The post mentions self-harm, which is not the same as preparing to end one's life but indicates a serious level of distress. There's no direct statement about preparing to end their life.\n   - \"Q6\": The user mentions self-harm, indicating they have done something harmful but not explicitly to end their life.\n\n**Severity Assessment:**\nGiven the information, the user has explicitly stated being suicidal and has self-harmed, indicating a serious level of distress and past action. While there's no clear indication of current planning or preparation to end their life, the presence of suicidal thoughts and self-harm is significant.\n\nThe closest matching severity level based on the provided information is related to having thoughts about killing oneself (Severity: 2) and having done something harmful (self-harm), which is a serious indicator.\n\nHowever, the exact severity depends on interpreting \"suicidal\" and the presence of self-harm. Since \"suicidal\" implies thoughts of killing oneself and there's evidence of self-harm (doing something harmful), the severity can be considered higher than just having thoughts.\n\nThus, the JSON response based on the given template and rationale is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied by the mention of being suicidal\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user explicitly mentions being suicidal\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"Implied through past self-harm and being suicidal\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The user mentions self-harm, indicating they have done something harmful\",\n  \"severity\": 6 is not directly applicable due to lack of explicit preparation or current action to end life, but given the suicidal thoughts and self-harm, a high severity is warranted. Considering the closest match, \"severity\": 4 or 5 might be more appropriate based on the presence of suicidal thoughts and past action (self-harm). However, without explicit current intention or planning, a score of \"severity\": 4 seems most fitting.\n}\n```\n\nHence, a simplified JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied by the mention of being suicidal\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user explicitly mentions being suicidal\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"Implied through past self-harm and being suicidal\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The user mentions self-harm, indicating they have done something harmful\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

Severity: 1**\nThe post expresses feelings of being \"fucked in the head,\" \"overwhelmed,\" and \"irritated,\" but it doesn't directly mention wishing to be dead or not waking up. Thus, it doesn't directly fulfill this criterion, so the response is N/A.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThere's no explicit mention or implication of thoughts about killing oneself. The post is more about the current state of feeling overwhelmed and irritated. So, the response is N/A.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nAs there's no indication of thoughts about killing oneself, there's also no indication of thinking about how to do it. Thus, the response is N/A.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nSince there are no thoughts about killing oneself mentioned, there's no indication of having an intention to act on such thoughts. So, the response is N/A.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThe post doesn't contain any details or indications of planning to kill oneself. Therefore, the response is N/A.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not mention or imply any action, preparation, or intent to end one's life. Hence, the response is N/A.\n\nGiven the information and feelings expressed in the post, it seems more related to frustration and being overwhelmed rather than directly indicating suicidal thoughts or actions. Therefore, based on the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics, the severity is rated as 0 because the post is not directly related to suicide.\n\nHere is the JSON response based on the template:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```"

Severity:1**\nThe post implies a sense of hopelessness and worthlessness (\"People will miss me but I have no future and they are better off without me\"), but it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. However, the overall tone suggests a significant level of dissatisfaction with life. So, the statement that best fits is \"N/A\" is not entirely correct because it leans towards wishing they were not alive due to feeling like an outsider and having \"no future.\" However, it's not a direct wish.\n\n   \"Q1\": \"The post implies feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, which could be interpreted as wishing they were not alive, but it's not a direct statement.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\nThe post contains the statement \"People will miss me but I have no future and they are better off without me,\" which can be interpreted as having thoughts that could be related to self-harm or suicide, given the context that they feel they are \"better off without\" them.

The mention of planning and preparing to \"just do it\" suggests preparation.\n   - \"Q6\": The user is using substances in a potentially harmful way and has a plan, indicating some level of preparation.\n\nGiven these observations, the severity can be determined.\n\nThe post directly mentions planning suicide and having a solid plan, indicating a high severity level. The user's expression of intention to act on their suicidal thoughts and having worked out the details aligns with a severity level of 5.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, the user's actions (using sleeping pills and drinking) and the fact that they are still deciding on the \"where and when\" might slightly temper the assessment. Nonetheless, the explicit plan and intention suggest a high level of severity.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user has expressed a wish to end their life.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post directly mentions planning suicide.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user mentions having a solid plan.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user expresses an intention to carry out their plan if their situation doesn't improve.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post indicates that the user has a plan and is deciding on the logistics.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The user is using substances in a potentially harmful way and has a plan, indicating some level of preparation.\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the user has worked out the details of their plan and intends to carry it out, but there's no clear indication they've taken concrete steps towards execution beyond the preparatory stage described."

This aligns with wishing not to exist, which is akin to wishing to be dead. Thus, \"Q1\": The post implies a wish not to exist.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post states, \"Am ai gonna kill myself, probably one day...\" This directly indicates thoughts about killing oneself. Thus, \"Q2\": The post directly mentions thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no explicit mention of how the person might kill themselves. The statement is more about the possibility of it happening \"one day\" without detailing the method. Thus, \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe phrase \"probably one day\" could imply a vague intention or consideration of suicide as a potential future action. However, it's not a clear indication of current intention. Thus, \"Q4\": The post implies a potential future intention but is not definitive.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication in the post that the person has started to work out the details of how to kill themselves. Thus, \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not indicate that the person has taken any action or made preparations to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven these observations, the post most directly fulfills criteria Q1 and Q2. While it implies some level of consideration or vague future intention (Q4), it does not clearly indicate a specific plan or action towards suicide.\n\nThe highest severity level directly supported by the text is Q2, as it explicitly mentions thoughts about killing oneself. The severity is therefore rated based on the highest criterion met.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish not to exist.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post directly mentions thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies a potential future intention but is not definitive.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

Severity: 4**\n   - The user states, \"I want to be done with life, I have for years, but I can't do that to my family.\"\n   - This indicates they have had thoughts about ending their life and the consideration of acting on them was present but was halted by the thought of the impact on their family.\n   - \"Q4\": The user had thoughts and some intention but was restrained by the consideration of their family's feelings.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The post says, \"Could someone please talk to me?\" which implies the user is seeking conversation, possibly indicating they are feeling isolated or in distress.\n\n2. The user directly asks for someone to talk to them, indicating a desire for human interaction.\n\nLet's analyze the post against the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics:\n\n- **Q1: Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?**\nThe post does not directly express a wish to be dead or not wake up. However, the request for someone to talk to could imply the person is in a state of distress. Thus, it's not a clear \"yes\" but could be considered a potential indicator of underlying issues. So, the response is \"N/A\" because it doesn't directly fulfill the criteria.\n\n- **Q2: Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post does not directly mention thoughts about killing oneself. So, it's \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q3: Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no mention or implication of the user thinking about methods of suicide. So, it's \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q4: Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe post doesn't directly or indirectly indicate an intention to act on suicidal thoughts. So, it's \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q5: Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\nThe post does not indicate that the user has started to work out the details of a suicide plan. So, it's \"N/A\".\n\n- **Q6: Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThere's no indication that the user has taken any action towards ending their life. So, it's \"N/A\".\n\nGiven the information provided and the analysis, the severity is not directly related to the explicit metrics of the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. However, the user's request to talk to someone could imply they are in distress. The scale is primarily used for assessing suicidal ideation and behavior. While the post indicates the user is seeking support, which is a positive sign as they are reaching out, it doesn't directly fit into the severity scale provided.\n\nTherefore, while there's an implicit indication of distress, the post doesn't directly fulfill any of the criteria for severity levels 1 through 6 based on the information given. The closest interpretation related to severity would be to consider the act of reaching out as a cry for help or an indication of distress, but without explicit statements related to suicidal ideation or behavior.\n\nThe response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis response is chosen because the post does not directly indicate suicidal ideation or behavior as outlined in the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. While it indicates distress or a need for support, the scale provided is for assessing suicidal severity, and the post doesn't directly fulfill the criteria for any of the severity levels. Therefore, the severity is rated as 0, indicating it's not directly related to suicide based on the explicit metrics provided."

Thus, it fulfills the criteria for having suicidal ideations, which is more than just wishing to be dead. So, the direct answer isn't here, but it's related. **\"Q1\": \"N/A but implies more severe thoughts\"**\n\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post explicitly states, \"I should kill myself to stop this feeling.\" This directly indicates that the person has had thoughts about killing themselves. **\"Q2\": \"Explicit mention of suicidal thoughts\"**\n\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no mention of how they might kill themselves.

However, it implies a past suicide attempt and current curiosity about it.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post mentions a past suicide attempt (\"I hung myself last year\") and curiosity about it, but doesn't directly state current thoughts about killing themselves.\n   - \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post doesn't indicate that the author is currently thinking about how to kill themselves; instead, it mentions curiosity about a past attempt.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The post does not indicate current intention to act on suicidal thoughts.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

The consideration of asking for a video is not an action towards ending their life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A\n\nHowever, given the context that the author has previously attempted suicide (\"I hung myself last year\"), the severity should be considered based on the closest relevant criteria and the overall context. The closest relevant information is that the author has a history of a suicide attempt, which directly corresponds to having \"done anything... to end your life\" in the past.\n\nGiven this, the severity is not directly measurable by the current thoughts or intentions but indicates a history of a severe attempt. The post's content suggests the author is reflecting on a past attempt rather than indicating current suicidal ideation or intent. Thus, the severity should be evaluated based on the fact that there's a history of an attempt (which would score 6 if it were current) but currently, the post does not directly indicate any of the criteria being met in the present tense.\n\nTherefore, considering the post's focus on past actions and curiosity rather than current intent or ideation, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": \"Past attempt mentioned, not current action\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning here for a \"severity\" of 0 is based on the fact that the post does not directly indicate current suicidal ideation or intent as per the questions. However, it's worth noting that the post does indicate a history of a serious suicide attempt, which is a significant risk factor. The evaluation here strictly follows the criteria provided, focusing on current thoughts and actions rather than past events. If the scale were to consider past attempts directly, the interpretation might differ."

So, \"Q5\": The post suggests they have intention and possibly worked out details.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post doesn't directly state they've done, started, or prepared to do anything but implies a readiness (\"I've decided, even on the day\"). So, \"Q6\": While it doesn't directly state they've prepared, the implication is strong.\n\nGiven these observations, let's compile the response in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A - The post implies a deeper context of suicidal thoughts but doesn't directly state wishing to be dead or sleep without waking up.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies they have had thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post implies they have thought about it.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user has had thoughts and intention of acting on them.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post suggests they have intention and possibly worked out details.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post implies readiness to act but doesn't directly state they've prepared to do anything to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the user indicates having worked out the details (\"I've decided, even on the day\") and having the intention to carry out the plan, which corresponds to the fifth question on the scale. While they haven't explicitly stated they've started to do or prepared anything to end their life, the level of decision and planning implies a high severity level, justifying a rating of 5."

However, it doesn't directly express a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up. So, the post does not directly fulfill this criterion, but it hints at a negative sentiment towards life.\n\n   - \"Q1\": N/A (though there's a negative sentiment, it doesn't directly indicate wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up)\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post does not directly mention thoughts about killing oneself. The sentiment is more about the frustration with life's circumstances rather than expressing a desire to end one's life.\n\n   - \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?

Severity: 6**\nThe post doesn't suggest any action or preparation towards ending one's life.\n\n   - \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven the analysis, the post expresses frustration and a negative sentiment towards life but does not directly indicate any suicidal thoughts or intentions. The closest it gets is expressing that \"Life ain't worth all that bs and drama,\" which is more about the struggle with life's circumstances than a direct expression of suicidal ideation.\n\nTherefore, the severity is rated as 0 because the post does not directly relate to suicide or suicidal ideation based on the provided metrics.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```"

Severity: 1**\nThe post doesn't directly state wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up, but it implies a significant level of distress related to self-harm and suicidal thoughts. So, while not directly answering this, the context implies a deeper issue. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A directly, but implied distress.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post explicitly mentions \"thinking over and over again about the idea of suicide,\" which directly corresponds to having thoughts about killing herself. So, \"Q2\": The user has had thoughts about killing herself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThe post does not mention thinking about the method of suicide. Thus, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post implies a level of distress and a need for immediate support (\"before I can't take it anymore\"), suggesting that the thoughts are potentially influencing her state of mind significantly, but it doesn't directly state an intention to act. So, \"Q4\": N/A directly, but the context suggests a risk.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication in the post that she has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan. Thus, \"Q5\": N/A.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not indicate that she has taken any action or made preparations to end her life. So, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nGiven the information and the explicit mention of having thoughts about suicide, the post aligns most closely with **Severity: 2** because it directly mentions having thoughts about suicide.\n\nHere's the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user has had thoughts about killing herself\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis assessment is based on the explicit content of the post and the direct correlation with the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics."

I always will.\" This indicates a strong desire for their current state or life to end, aligning with wishing they were dead or not waking up. So, \"Q1\": The post expresses a wish for their life to end.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" Severity: 2\nThe statement \"I think I'm going to go, I'll try again\" suggests previous attempts or thoughts about ending their life, as \"try again\" implies a prior attempt or consideration. Thus, \"Q2\": The post indicates thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" Severity: 3\nThe mention of \"I have a plan, I have my notes\" directly implies that the individual has been thinking about how to end their life, having presumably made some form of plan or preparation. So, \"Q3\": The post indicates thinking about how to kill themselves.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" Severity: 4\nThe presence of a plan and the statement \"I think I'm going to go, I'll try again\" along with \"It's all I want\" shows not just thoughts but an intention to act on those thoughts. Hence, \"Q4\": The post indicates an intention to act on their thoughts.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" Severity: 5\nThe post mentions having a plan and notes, which signifies that they have worked out some details.

However, it stops short of explicitly stating an action has been taken or started. The statement \"I have my notes\" could be interpreted as preparation. Therefore, \"Q6\": The post could be seen as indicating preparation.\n\nGiven these observations, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post expresses a wish for their life to end.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post indicates thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post indicates thinking about how to kill themselves.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post indicates an intention to act on their thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post indicates that they have worked out details and intended to carry out the plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post could be seen as indicating preparation.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 6 because the post strongly suggests preparation to end their life (\"I have a plan, I have my notes\") and the intent to do so (\"I think I'm going to go, I'll try again\"), which aligns closely with the criteria for Severity: 6, indicating that they have done something, started to do something, or prepared to do something to end their life."

However, there's an implicit wish to not be alive due to the unbearable situation. So, this criterion is somewhat fulfilled but not directly. \n   - \"Q1\": The post implies a state of being extremely distressed, which could be seen as wishing not to be in such a state anymore.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** - The post directly mentions, \"I am really thinking about ending it all,\" which clearly indicates having thoughts about killing oneself.\n   - \"Q2\": The statement directly fulfills this criterion.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** - The post does not mention any specifics about how they might end their life.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no mention of thinking about the method.\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** - The statement \"I am really thinking about ending it all\" suggests they are having thoughts about suicide, and the context implies a level of desperation that could suggest an intention.\n   - \"Q4\": The expression of thinking about ending it all implies some level of intention.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"** - There's no mention of working out the details of a plan.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no indication of planning.\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"** - There's no mention of taking any action or preparing to end their life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no indication of action taken.\n\nGiven the analysis, the post directly fulfills criterion 2 (\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\") and implies fulfillment of criterion 4 (\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\") due to the context and the explicit mention of thinking about ending their life. However, it does not directly fulfill criteria 3, 5, and 6 as it doesn't discuss methods, planning, or taking action.\n\n\nThe severity is thus aligned with the highest criterion directly fulfilled, which is 2 (having thoughts about killing oneself), but considering the context and the mention of thinking about ending it all, it leans more towards having some intention (Severity: 4). However, without explicit details on planning or action, it cannot be rated higher than 4.\n\n\nHere is the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"The post implies a state of being extremely distressed, which could be seen as wishing not to be in such a state anymore.\",\n\"Q2\": \"The statement directly fulfills this criterion.\",\n\"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q4\": \"The expression of thinking about ending it all implies some level of intention.\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 4\n}"

Thus, it's not directly related to this question.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post implies a decision to end one's life (\"my decision\") but does not directly state having thoughts about killing oneself.

It talks about killing others.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The post implies a level of planning or considering an action (\"if i kill my drs first\"), but it's about harming others, not directly about suicidal intentions.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

However, it doesn't directly state that they have taken steps towards ending their life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the post's severity isn't directly related to the standard Columbia scale as it discusses harming others rather than self-harm. Yet, there's an underlying implication of suicidal ideation linked to the decision mentioned.\n\nGiven this context, the most relevant interpretation is that the post suggests a level of planning and intention related to a drastic action that includes the individual's demise, albeit framed within a context of violence towards others.\n\nSince the post doesn't directly answer the questions as they pertain to suicidal ideation or behavior but implies a severe level of distress and consideration of violent acts (potentially as a prelude to or in conjunction with self-harm), we must consider the closest matching severity.\n\nThe post implies a serious level of intent and planning related to a harmful action and a decision that likely involves ending one's life. Thus, while not directly answering the questions, it suggests a severe level of distress.\n\nTherefore, evaluating the closest match:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning for a severity of 6 is based on the implication of a significant and drastic action that includes the individual's life and a level of planning or consideration, even though it's framed as part of a violent act towards others. The post's discussion of making a decision and ensuring \"its clear theyre to blame for my decision\" implies a potential act of self-harm or suicide linked to the narrative of harming others. This interpretation stands despite the direct questions not being answered in the traditional sense, as the context implies a complex intertwining of violence and potential self-harm.\n\nHowever, it's critical to recognize that the primary concern of the post is not directly captured by the Columbia scale as it focuses on harm to others. Thus, while we assign a severity based on the available information and implications, the actual handling of such a post should consider both the suicidal ideation and the threat of violence towards others."

It only states the intention. **\"Q3\": N/A**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe statement \"If things don't get better soon I'm going to kill myself\" implies an intention to act on their suicidal thoughts if their condition doesn't improve. This indicates some level of intention. **\"Q4\": The post implies having an intention to act on their suicidal thoughts.**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

It mentions using cutting as a distraction from anxiety, but this is not directly related to suicidal actions. **\"Q6\": N/A**\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- The post directly indicates having thoughts about killing themselves (Q2).\n- It implies an intention to act on these thoughts (Q4).\n\nThus, the severity should be based on the highest relevant question that is directly supported by the content.\n\nThe response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post explicitly mentions having thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies having an intention to act on their suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```\n\nThe assigned severity is **4**, as the post indicates having thoughts about killing themselves and an intention to act on them, aligning with the criteria for severity level 4."

I'm all over the place.\"\n\n1. **Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? Severity:1**\n   - The post does not directly express a wish to be dead or to not wake up. It mentions being \"all over the place\" on their birthday and wanting to get feelings out, but there's no clear indication of wishing to be dead. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\n   - There's no direct or indirect mention of thoughts about killing themselves in the post. The language used is more about emotional distress or a desire for support. So, \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\n   - The post does not indicate any thoughts about methods of suicide. Hence, \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?

Severity:6**\n   - The post does not suggest any action or preparation towards ending their life. It appears to be a cry for emotional support. Therefore, \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven the analysis, the post is more about expressing emotional distress and seeking support rather than expressing suicidal thoughts or intentions. The overall **severity** is thus evaluated as 0, as there's no direct relation to suicide.\n\nThe JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```"

Yet, given the overall context and the specifics provided (like having a method and a timeline), it suggests a very high level of severity. The severity is thus categorized as 6 due to the explicit suicidal intent and planning, aligning with the scale's highest level for immediate risk.\n\nBut it's worth noting, given the explicit plan and method mentioned, and the clear intent, one could argue it leans towards the highest severity level. Thus, the response maintains \"severity\": 6, based on the overall context and explicit intent.\n\nIf you're or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts or is in distress, please reach out to a mental health professional or a suicide prevention hotline."

However, this is not directly addressed, so we consider it N/A for this specific question.\n\n   \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** (Severity: 2)\n   The post mentions \"I'm thinking about doing it,\" which can imply thoughts about killing oneself, given the context that the person is discussing their emotional distress and contemplating a drastic action.\n\n   \"Q2\": The phrase \"I'm thinking about doing it\" implies suicidal thoughts.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?** (Severity: 3)\n   The post does not directly state that the person has been thinking about the method to end their life. It focuses more on the emotional state and the desire to talk to someone.\n\n   \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?** (Severity: 4)\n   The person mentions \"I'm thinking about doing it,\" which suggests having thoughts about suicide and possibly some intention, but they also express uncertainty and a desire to talk to someone, indicating a mixed state.\n\n   \"Q4\": The expression of thinking about \"doing it\" and the ambivalence (\"Idk what to do\") could imply some level of intention.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?** (Severity: 5)\n   There's no indication that the person has started to work out the details of a suicide plan. The focus is on their emotional distress and the desire for human connection.\n\n   \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?** (Severity: 6)\n   The post does not indicate that the person has taken any action or made preparations to end their life. They have, however, called hotlines, showing some action towards seeking help.\n\n   \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most relevant criteria are Q2 and Q4, as they directly relate to having thoughts about suicide and some level of intention. The expression of suicidal thoughts (\"I'm thinking about doing it\") aligns with Q2, and the ambivalence about acting on these thoughts (\"Idk what to do\") could be associated with Q4.\n\nThe response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": The phrase \"I'm thinking about doing it\" implies suicidal thoughts,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": The expression of thinking about \"doing it\" and the ambivalence (\"Idk what to do\") could imply some level of intention,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```\n\nThe assigned severity is 4 because the post indicates having thoughts about suicide with some intention of acting on them, as suggested by \"I'm thinking about doing it\" and the overall context of emotional distress and seeking help. The severity level of 4 is chosen over 2 because the person's statement not only indicates thoughts about suicide but also a level of consideration or intention (\"thinking about doing it\"), which aligns more closely with having both thoughts and some intention to act."

Severity: 1**\nThe post mentions not eating for the last 4 days and stating \"To tried. For anything,\" which could be interpreted as a sign of distress or giving up. However, there's no direct mention of wishing to be dead or not waking up. So, while it implies a possible wish for an escape or change, it doesn't directly fulfill this criterion. Thus, \"N/A\" for a direct correlation.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post doesn't directly mention thoughts about killing oneself. The statement is more about not eating and a vague expression that could imply hopelessness (\"To tried. For anything\"). There's no clear indication of suicidal thoughts. So, \"N/A\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no mention or implication of thinking about methods to end one's life. The focus is on not eating, which could be a form of self-harm but isn't directly linked to planning suicide. So, \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post doesn't explicitly or implicitly indicate having thoughts about suicide or the intention to act on them. So, \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication of planning or intending to carry out a suicide plan. So, \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nNot eating for 4 days can be considered a harmful behavior that could potentially end one's life, though it may not be directly intended as a suicidal act. It indicates a significant level of distress. This could be seen as \"done anything\" that endangers their life, though the intent behind not eating isn't explicitly stated as being to end their life.\n\nGiven these observations, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"Not eating for 4 days could be seen as doing something that endangers life, though not directly stated as to end life\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while the behavior described (not eating for 4 days) is dangerous and potentially life-threatening, assigning a severity score of 6 might not perfectly align with the intent of the scale if the individual's intention was not to end their life. The scale is primarily focused on suicidal ideation and behaviors with the intent to end one's life. The response provided here reflects a strict interpretation based on the available information and the scale's criteria.\n\nFor a more nuanced evaluation, considering the context and potential intent behind the behavior (not eating) is crucial. If the behavior is a result of suicidal ideation, it would be scored accordingly. If it's due to other forms of distress or mental health issues, while still dangerous, the scoring might reflect the directness of suicidal intent.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and focusing strictly on the scale:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"Not eating for 4 days could be seen as doing something that endangers life\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```"

The closest matching severity based on the given criteria is **Severity: 4**, because they had thoughts about killing themselves and had some intention of acting on them, as indicated by their statement to their mom and the reason they provided for not following through.\n\n\nHere's the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied, but more severe\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Explicitly mentioned wanting to kill themselves\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"Implied intention, deterred by fear\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

Life is gloomy and monotonous I hate my life , I don't want to live.\" This indicates a strong wish not to be alive, fulfilling the criteria for Severity: 1.\n\n   \"Q1\": The user explicitly expresses a wish to die and not live, indicating a fulfillment of this criterion.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The statement \"I want to die\" can be interpreted as having thoughts about ending one's life, though it doesn't directly mention killing oneself. It's more about the desire to not exist or be dead.\n\n   \"Q2\": The post implies a desire to die, which can be associated with thoughts of ending one's life, though not explicitly stated as killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - There's no mention of how the person might end their life; the post simply expresses a desire not to live.\n\n   \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no indication of thinking about the method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The post says \"HELP HELP,\" which suggests a cry for help rather than an intention to act on suicidal thoughts. It indicates distress but also a desire for intervention or support.\n\n   \"Q4\": N/A, because while there's a desire to die, the \"HELP HELP\" suggests seeking assistance rather than intending to act on these thoughts.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - There's no indication that the person has started to work out or has worked out the details of ending their life.\n\n   \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no mention of planning.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post does not indicate any action taken or preparation to end their life.\n\n   \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no indication of taking any action.\n\nGiven the information and the explicit wish to die along with a clear expression of not wanting to live, the severity is high due to the direct expression of suicidal desire. Although there's no explicit plan or action mentioned, the expression of a desire to die and hatred for life is significant.\n\nThe JSON response based on the given template:\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user explicitly expresses a wish to die and not live, indicating a fulfillment of this criterion.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies a desire to die, which can be associated with thoughts of ending one's life, though not explicitly stated as killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\nThe severity is rated as 2 because the post directly indicates having thoughts about dying (\"I want to die\") and not wanting to live, aligning with the second question's criteria about having thoughts of killing oneself, albeit not explicitly. The presence of \"HELP HELP\" suggests a level of distress that is being communicated, potentially seeking intervention."

Severity: 2**\nThe post explicitly mentions \"IF I KILL MYSELF,\" directly indicating thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n\"Q2\": The post explicitly mentions \"IF I KILL MYSELF,\" showing thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no specific mention of how the person might kill themselves.\n\n\"Q3\": N/A (There's no mention of thinking about the method.)\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe phrase \"THIS WORLD DONT WANT ME ANYWAY\" followed by \"IF I KILL MYSELF\" can be interpreted as having some level of intention or rationale for acting on suicidal thoughts, given the context of frustration and hopelessness.\n\n\"Q4\": The context suggests some intention or rationalization for suicidal thoughts.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

Severity: 6**\nThere's no explicit mention of actions taken or preparations made to end their life.\n\n\"Q6\": N/A (No actions or preparations are mentioned.)\n\nGiven the explicit mention of \"IF I KILL MYSELF\" and the context suggesting a rationale or intention behind suicidal thoughts, the post aligns most closely with Severity: 4, as it indicates having thoughts about killing oneself and some level of intention or rationalization for those thoughts.\n\nHere's the response in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post explicitly mentions 'IF I KILL MYSELF,' showing thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The context suggests some intention or rationalization for suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

Thus, it fulfills the criteria beyond just wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up; it's a more severe expression. So, \"Q1\": N/A because it goes beyond the severity level of this question.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The post explicitly states \"I'm about to fucking kill myself\" and \"I AM going to kill myself,\" clearly indicating thoughts about killing oneself. Thus, \"Q2\": Fulfills this criteria.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The post doesn't explicitly mention how they plan to kill themselves, so there's no direct evidence to fulfill this specific criteria. Thus, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The statement \"I'm about to fucking kill myself\" and \"I AM going to kill myself\" indicates a clear intention to act on these thoughts. Thus, \"Q4\": Fulfills this criteria.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - As mentioned, the post doesn't specify any details on how they plan to kill themselves, so it doesn't directly fulfill this criteria based on the information given. Thus, \"Q5\": N/A.\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post doesn't provide evidence that they have done, started, or prepared anything to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nGiven the information and the expressed intention to kill oneself (\"I'm about to fucking kill myself\" and \"I AM going to kill myself\"), the severity level leans towards the higher end because of the clear intention. The post directly indicates having thoughts about killing oneself and an intention to act on them, aligning with a severity level of 4.\n\nHere is the response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post explicitly states thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post indicates a clear intention to act on these thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```\n\nThis assessment is based on the explicit expression of suicidal intent and the desire to end one's life, indicating a significant level of severity according to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE."

Severity:1**\nThe post doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up, but it questions the value of life and implies that it might be better to die sooner to suffer less. \n   - \"Q1\": The statement \"I'm gonna suffer less if I decide to go sooner\" indirectly suggests a wish to die sooner, which is related to this criterion.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity:2**\nThe post implies thoughts about dying and the consideration of dying sooner, but it's framed more as a philosophical or existential question rather than a direct expression of suicidal thoughts.\n   - \"Q2\": The text implies consideration of ending life (\"if I decide to go sooner\"), which can be interpreted as having thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity:3**\nThe post doesn't discuss methods of suicide.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no mention of how to end life.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity:4**\nThe post suggests a contemplation of dying sooner but doesn't clearly indicate an intention to act on these thoughts.\n   - \"Q4\": The statement \"I'm gonna suffer less if I decide to go sooner\" could suggest some level of consideration or intention, but it's not explicit.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity:5**\nThere's no indication in the post that the author has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no discussion of planning or intending to carry out a suicide plan.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity:6**\nThe post doesn't indicate any action or preparation to end life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no mention of taking any steps towards ending life.\n\n**Severity Assessment:**\nThe post expresses a nihilistic view of life and implies a consideration of dying or ending suffering by dying sooner. While it doesn't directly state a clear intention to commit suicide or describe any plans or actions towards that end, it suggests a level of contemplation about the value of life and potentially about ending it to escape suffering.\n\nGiven the criteria, the closest match is the implication of having thoughts related to \"wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up\" and \"actually had any thoughts about killing yourself\" due to the contemplation of dying sooner to reduce suffering. The severity seems to be leaning towards having thoughts about killing oneself but lacks a clear expression of intent or action.\n\nTherefore, the severity score should reflect the presence of thoughts related to suicide (Severity:2) rather than a direct wish to die or clear intent to act.\n\nHere's the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The statement 'I'm gonna suffer less if I decide to go sooner' indirectly suggests a wish to die sooner.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The text implies consideration of ending life ('if I decide to go sooner'), which can be interpreted as having thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The statement 'I'm gonna suffer less if I decide to go sooner' could suggest some level of consideration or intention, but it's not explicit.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

Severity: 1**\nThe post does not directly indicate that the individual has wished they were dead or wished to sleep and not wake up. The tone seems somewhat flippant or dismissive about a future state (\"Obviously it won't matter afterwards\"), but there's no clear indication of a death wish. So, \"N/A\" for this criterion.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe statement \"Obviously it won't matter afterwards\" could be interpreted in various ways, but one possible interpretation is that the individual is contemplating a state where nothing matters, potentially implying a suicidal thought. However, the tone is somewhat casual and uses \"lmao,\" which suggests a level of joking or not taking the implication seriously. Still, there's a possible allusion to a future state that could be related to suicidal ideation. So, there's a potential, albeit vague, indication here: \"Possible suicidal thoughts, but context is ambiguous.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThe post does not provide any information about thinking about methods of suicide. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThere's no clear indication that the individual has had thoughts with the intention of acting on them. The post's tone doesn't directly suggest a serious intent. So, \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThe post does not indicate that the individual has worked out details of a suicide plan. So, \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThere's no indication that the individual has taken any action towards ending their life. The concern about the cost of something to catch the bus doesn't directly relate to suicidal actions. So, \"N/A\".\n\nGiven the analysis, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Possible suicidal thoughts, but context is ambiguous\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning behind assigning a severity of 2 is based on the possible interpretation of the post hinting at suicidal thoughts (\"Obviously it won't matter afterwards\") but is done in a casual and somewhat joking manner (\"lmao\"). The post does not clearly fulfill the criteria for severity levels 3 through 6, and the tone complicates a straightforward interpretation of the statement as indicative of serious suicidal ideation. Therefore, if we are to assign a severity based on the available information, it would be at the level of having had thoughts about killing oneself, but with significant ambiguity and context that mitigates the severity."

        "llama_response": "To evaluate the given post, \"Just someone to talk Feeling worthless, is there someone to talk?\" according to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics, let's break down the post against each question.\n\n1. **Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? Severity: 1**\nThe post expresses feeling worthless and a desire to talk to someone, which can be related to a negative emotional state. However, it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or not wake up. So, the direct fulfillment of this criterion isn't clear, but the emotional state described could imply such feelings indirectly. \"Q1\": \"N/A but implies negative emotional state\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post does not directly mention thoughts about killing oneself. The language used (\"Feeling worthless\") suggests a negative emotional state but doesn't directly indicate suicidal thoughts. \"Q2\": \"N/A\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no indication in the post that the person is thinking about methods of suicide. \"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post does not indicate any intention to act on suicidal thoughts. \"Q4\": \"N/A\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no evidence the person has started working out details of a suicide plan. \"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not suggest that the person has taken any action towards ending their life. \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nGiven the information in the post, while it does express a feeling of worthlessness and a desire to talk to someone, it does not directly indicate any suicidal thoughts or intentions. The closest related criterion is the expression of a negative emotional state (\"Feeling worthless\"), which is a risk factor for suicide but doesn't directly fulfill the criteria for severity level 1.\n\nHowever, the expression of feeling worthless and seeking someone to talk to can be seen as a cry for help or an indication of emotional distress. The most relevant severity rating based on the given metrics and the information provided in the post seems to be related to the emotional state that could be associated with the first question.\n\nThus, considering the closest match and the overall context:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A but implies negative emotional state\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis response assigns a severity of 1, not because the post directly states a wish to be dead or not wake up, but because it implies a significant level of emotional distress that could be related to such feelings, and it's the closest match among the given criteria. However, it's essential to treat such expressions with care and consider them as potential indicators of deeper issues."

However, the sentiment is strongly leaning towards a desire not to exist.\n   - **\"Q2\": \"The post implies a strong desire not to be alive but does not directly state having thoughts about killing themselves.\"**\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** Severity: 3\n   - The post does not mention any thoughts about methods of suicide.\n   - **\"Q3\": \"N/A\"**\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** Severity: 4\n   - The post does not directly indicate an intention to act on suicidal thoughts, though the overall tone is very despairing.\n   - **\"Q4\": \"N/A\"**\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"** Severity: 5\n   - There's no indication that the user has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan.\n   - **\"Q5\": \"N/A\"**\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"** Severity: 6\n   - The post does not indicate any action or preparation towards ending their life.\n   - **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"**\n\nThe post's severity is primarily indicated by the user's expression of a long-standing wish to not be alive and feelings of extreme isolation and despair. The highest severity level directly supported by the text is Severity 1, due to the explicit wish to have been dead.\n\nGiven this analysis, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a wish to have been dead since they were 7, indicating a long-standing wish to not be alive.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies a strong desire not to be alive but does not directly state having thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis response reflects that while the post is concerning and indicates a deep-seated wish not to be alive, it does not directly indicate suicidal thoughts or plans beyond that initial criterion. Thus, the severity is rated as 1."

Maybe I'll finally have some peace.\" This implies a certain level of acceptance or wish for death, indirectly suggesting that the person might be wishing for an end to their suffering. Thus, it somewhat aligns with wishing they were dead or could go to sleep and not wake up. \n\"Q1\": The post implies a wish for death indirectly.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe statement \"Always knew I'd eat myself to death\" suggests that the individual has been aware of the potential self-destructive nature of their eating habits. However, it doesn't directly indicate thoughts of killing themselves in the conventional sense (e.g., through immediate violent means). Instead, it implies a more passive form of self-destruction.\n\"Q2\": The post implies self-destructive behavior but not direct suicidal thoughts.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThe individual mentions knowing they'd \"eat [themselves] to death,\" which can be seen as having a notion of how their actions might lead to their death.

Instead, it discusses the potential outcome of their eating habits, suggesting a more passive acknowledgment rather than an active intention.\n\"Q4\": N/A as there's no clear intention to act on suicidal thoughts.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\nThere's no indication that the person has started to work out or has worked out the details of a suicide plan. The reference to eating themselves to death is more about acknowledging a potential consequence of their behavior rather than planning to end their life.\n\"Q5\": N/A as there's no evidence of planning.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThe post implies continuing with self-destructive eating habits (\"Always knew I'd eat myself to death\"), which could be seen as doing something that could potentially end their life. However, it's more about the continuation of existing harmful behavior rather than a new action or preparation to end their life.\n\"Q6\": The post implies continuing harmful behavior.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- \"Q1\": The post implies a wish for death indirectly.\n- \"Q2\": The post implies self-destructive behavior but not direct suicidal thoughts.\n- \"Q3\": The post indicates an awareness of the potential fatal outcome of their actions.\n- \"Q4\": N/A\n- \"Q5\": N/A\n- \"Q6\": The post implies continuing harmful behavior.\n\nThe overall severity is not directly related to active suicidal planning or immediate intent but indicates a level of acceptance or acknowledgment of potentially fatal self-destructive behavior. The closest match based on the given criteria would be a severity level that reflects the presence of some suicidal ideation or self-destructive behavior without a clear, active plan.\n\nThus, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish for death indirectly.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies self-destructive behavior but not direct suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post indicates an awareness of the potential fatal outcome of their actions.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post implies continuing harmful behavior.\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis assigns a severity level of 2 because the post indicates having had thoughts about potentially killing themselves through their actions (eating themselves to death), which aligns more closely with \"having thoughts about killing yourself\" in a broad, passive sense."

Although not directly wishing to be dead, the context implies a thought about dying. So, \"Q1\": The post implies a scenario of dying, which relates to wishing to be dead or not wake up, so it's not entirely N/A.\n\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" (Severity: 2)\nThe post mentions \"cb\" which could be interpreted as an abbreviation related to ending one's life or a specific method (though \"cb\" is not a standard abbreviation for this). The desire to have someone \"hold my hand while I was taking my last breaths\" suggests a scenario of dying or suicide. Thus, it implies thoughts about killing oneself. So, \"Q2\": The post implies thoughts about ending one's life.\n\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" (Severity: 3)\nWhile the post doesn't explicitly detail a method, the mention of \"cb\" and \"taking my last breaths\" could imply some thought about the process or method of dying. However, it's not clear or direct. So, \"Q3\": The post somewhat implies thinking about the process of dying.\n\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" (Severity: 4)\nThe post expresses a desire for companionship in a hypothetical dying scenario but doesn't directly indicate an intention to act on these thoughts. The phrase \"i know it'd never happen\" suggests a level of detachment or impossibility rather than a concrete plan. So, \"Q4\": N/A, as there's no clear indication of intention.\n\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" (Severity: 5)\nThe post doesn't provide details about working out a plan for suicide. The mention of \"cb\" is vague without further context. So, \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no clear indication of planning.\n\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" (Severity: 6)\nThere's no indication in the post that the person has taken any action or made preparations to end their life. So, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The post implies a scenario related to dying or suicide (Severity: 1 and 2).\n- It somewhat implies thinking about the process (Severity: 3), but lacks clarity.\n- There's no clear indication of intention (Severity: 4), planning (Severity: 5), or action (Severity: 6).\n\nTherefore, the severity should be evaluated based on the most directly related and clearly implied criteria.\n\n\nResponse in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a scenario of dying.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies thoughts about ending one's life.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post somewhat implies thinking about the process of dying.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 3\n}\n```\n\nThe post's severity is rated as 3 because it implies thoughts about killing oneself and somewhat about the method or process, without clear indication of intention, planning, or action."

Thus, it can be related to the first question due to the expression of extreme emotional pain (\"sick and tired of being alone\"). However, the direct language of wishing to be dead is not used; instead, it mentions being \"almost ready to kms\" (kill myself), which is a stronger statement. So, Q1 is somewhat related but not directly. Reasoning: The post doesn't directly state a wish to be dead but implies severe distress. So, \"Q1\": \"N/A (implied distress but not directly related)\".\n   \n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The statement \"almost ready to kms\" implies having thoughts about killing oneself. The abbreviation \"kms\" stands for \"kill myself,\" indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts. So, \"Q2\": \"The post directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself through 'almost ready to kms'\".\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The post doesn't provide details on whether the person has been thinking about the method. It directly jumps to the expression of being \"almost ready to kms\" without elaborating on the plan. So, \"Q3\": \"N/A (no details on the method)\".\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The statement \"almost ready to kms\" suggests a significant level of intention or being close to acting on suicidal thoughts. So, \"Q4\": \"The post implies having some intention as indicated by 'almost ready'\".\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - There's no indication that the person has started to work out or has worked out the details. So, \"Q5\": \"N/A (no indication of working out the details)\".\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post does not indicate any action taken or preparation made towards ending their life. So, \"Q6\": \"N/A (no indication of taking action or preparing)\".\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- The post directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself (Q2 fulfilled).\n- It suggests some level of intention (Q4 fulfilled).\n\nThe severity is therefore related to having thoughts about killing oneself and some intention of acting on them, which corresponds to a severity level of 4, as it directly mentions being \"almost ready to kms,\" indicating a significant level of intent.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A (implied distress but not directly related)\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself through 'almost ready to kms'\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A (no details on the method)\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies having some intention as indicated by 'almost ready'\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A (no indication of working out the details)\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A (no indication of taking action or preparing)\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

So, \"N/A\" for this criterion because it doesn't directly address the wish to be dead.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post implies consideration of taking a specific quantity of paracetamol, which can be interpreted as having thoughts about using it potentially to harm oneself or as a method to end one's life. Thus, it could be seen as having thoughts about killing oneself. So, \"Q2\": \"The post implies consideration of a potentially lethal act.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post shows a specific consideration of \"how\" by mentioning a quantity of paracetamol (3500), indicating a level of thought about the method. So, \"Q3\": \"The post specifies a quantity of paracetamol, indicating thought about the method.\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The questioning tone (\"or not ??\") might suggest uncertainty or inquiry rather than a clear intention. However, the fact that they are asking about a specific lethal quantity could imply some level of consideration towards acting. So, \"Q4\": \"The post could be interpreted as having some level of intention, but it's phrased as a question.\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - The post shows some level of detail (specifying 3500 of paracetamol), suggesting that the person has thought about the specifics. So, \"Q5\": \"The post indicates a level of planning or consideration of details.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - There's no indication in the post that the person has taken any action or made preparations to end their life; it's a question about the potential effect of an action. So, \"N/A\" because there's no evidence of action or preparation.\n\nGiven these observations, here's the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies consideration of a potentially lethal act.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post specifies a quantity of paracetamol, indicating thought about the method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post could be interpreted as having some level of intention, but it's phrased as a question.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post indicates a level of planning or consideration of details.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 5 because the post indicates that the person has thought about the method (taking paracetamol) and has considered a specific quantity (3500), showing a level of planning. However, it is phrased as a question, which slightly nuances the interpretation of their intent. According to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE, having started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill oneself and intending to carry out the plan corresponds to a severity level of 5."

However, it mentions being depressed. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A, but there's an indirect hint due to the mention of depression.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - There's no direct mention of thoughts about killing themselves. The post focuses on feelings of depression and a desire to be \"used and 'punished'\". So, \"Q2\": N/A.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - There's no mention or implication of thinking about methods of suicide. Hence, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The post doesn't directly reference suicidal thoughts or intentions. The intention mentioned is related to engaging in certain behaviors due to feelings of depression. So, \"Q4\": N/A.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - There's no indication of planning or intending to carry out a suicide plan. Therefore, \"Q5\": N/A.\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post does not indicate any actions taken or preparations made to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nHowever, the individual is expressing a desire to be \"used and 'punished'\" due to depression, which indicates a level of distress. While the post doesn't directly meet the criteria for any of the questions 1 through 6, the expression of depressive feelings and self-deprecating behavior could be considered a cry for help or an indication of being in a vulnerable state.\n\nGiven the information and the scale provided, the closest interpretation would be related to the individual's state of mind and potential risk due to their depression and the behaviors they're considering.\n\nSo, the JSON response, focusing on the direct interpretation of the given scale, would be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while the post's severity might be rated as 0 based on the direct criteria, the individual's situation suggests a need for support due to their expressed depression and harmful self-behaviors. A more nuanced evaluation might consider the overall context and potential indirect indicators of risk. \n\nIn a real-world application, a response to this post would likely involve offering support and resources for dealing with depression rather than solely evaluating it against a suicide severity scale."

Instead, it serves as a warning against overdosing based on the author's experience. Thus, **\"Q1\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** Severity: 2\n   - The post implies a past action (overdosing) but does not directly state that the author had thoughts about killing themselves at the time of writing.

So, **\"Q2\": \"N/A\"**.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** Severity: 3\n   - There's no indication that the author was thinking about how to kill themselves.

So, it could be indirectly related. However, there's no clear statement to confirm this. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" \nThe post doesn't directly mention thoughts about killing oneself. It mentions needing help and not knowing who to ask, indicating a cry for assistance but doesn't directly imply suicidal thoughts. Thus, \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" \nThere's no mention or implication of thinking about methods to end one's life. Thus, \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" \nThe post doesn't indicate having thoughts about suicide or the intention to act on them. Thus, \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" \nThere's no information or implication that the person has started to work out or has worked out details of a suicide plan. Thus, \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" \nThe post doesn't suggest that the person has done, started, or prepared to do anything to end their life. Thus, \"Q6\": N/A\n\nThe post is a cry for help, indicating distress and an inability to get assistance through usual channels (e.g., helpline numbers not responding). While it doesn't directly indicate suicidal ideation or behavior, it does signify a level of emotional distress that could be related to suicidal feelings.\n\nHowever, based on the given criteria and the content of the post, there's no direct evidence to assign a severity level based on the specific questions. The post's severity is more about the implied distress and need for help rather than explicit suicidal ideation or planning. Given the lack of direct evidence related to the specific questions, the severity should be considered in the context of the overall distress and the implicit need for immediate support.\n\nSince there's no clear indication of suicidal thoughts or actions as described in the questions, but the post does imply a significant level of distress and a need for help, one might argue it warrants a cautious interpretation. However, according to the strict definitions provided:\n\n{\n\"Q1\": N/A,\n\"Q2\": N/A,\n\"Q3\": N/A,\n\"Q4\": N/A,\n\"Q5\": N/A,\n\"Q6\": N/A,\n\"severity\": 0\n}\n\nThe reasoning is that the post, while indicative of distress and a need for help, does not directly fulfill any of the criteria outlined in the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. Thus, a severity score of 0 is technically appropriate as it doesn't directly relate to the specific suicidal ideation or behaviors described. However, it's crucial for responders to recognize the implicit distress and potentially offer support or guide the individual towards appropriate resources."

Severity: 1**\nThe post states, \"I've been wanting to commit suicide for months now.\" This indicates a strong desire to end their life, which is beyond merely wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up. However, the initial wish or desire can be inferred as they directly express a want to commit suicide. So, **Q1: Implied as they directly want to commit suicide.**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post directly mentions wanting to commit suicide, which clearly indicates they have had thoughts about killing themselves. **Q2: Yes, directly mentioned.**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThe post does not explicitly state that they have been thinking about how to commit suicide, but it mentions \"the marks are subsiding,\" which could imply self-harm or attempts.

However, there is no explicit mention of planning (Severity: 3 and 5) or taking action towards suicide (Severity: 6).\n\nGiven the information provided and following the C-SSRS metrics, the most severe level directly supported by the text is Severity: 2 (thoughts about killing oneself), and potentially Severity: 4 due to the interpreted intent from the statement about executing duties. However, the ambiguity around \"executing duties\" makes it less clear.\n\nThus, the most directly supported severity level without making assumptions is 2. Considering the potential interpretation of intent, it could be argued to be at Severity: 4, but this requires a more subjective interpretation.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The statement 'I don't want to live longer' indicates a clear wish not to be alive.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement 'I deserve to die and be out of everyone's life' shows thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A, as there's no mention of thinking about the method.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The statement 'today I really want to execute my duties' could imply an intention to act on their feelings, though it's somewhat ambiguous.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A, as there's no mention of working out the details of a plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A, as there's no indication of action or preparation.\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON reflects a severity level of 4 based on the interpretation that includes an intention to act on their suicidal thoughts, as suggested by the ambiguous statement. A more conservative interpretation based strictly on direct evidence would rate it at 2."

Thus, this criterion is implicitly met but not directly answered. So, \"Q1\": N/A but implied.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The post explicitly states an intention to kill oneself on a specific date (\"Killing myself on the 31st\"), indicating that the person has had thoughts about killing themselves. So, \"Q2\": The statement directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - While the post doesn't specify the method, it implies a level of planning by stating a specific date (\"on the 31st\"), suggesting some thought has been given to the timing if not the method. So, \"Q3\": Implied by planning the act for a specific date.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The post clearly states an intention (\"I'm going to finally do it on the 31st\"), showing that the thoughts are accompanied by an intention to act. So, \"Q4\": The statement directly indicates an intention to act on the thoughts.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - The post does not explicitly state that the individual has worked out the details, but it does express an intention to carry out the plan (\"I'm going to finally do it\"). So, \"Q5\": N/A because the details of the plan are not mentioned, but there is an expressed intent.\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post does not explicitly mention any preparatory actions taken to end their life, but stating a specific date implies some level of preparation or planning. So, \"Q6\": N/A because there's no explicit mention of actions taken or preparations made.\n\nGiven the analysis, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A but implied\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself\",\n  \"Q3\": \"Implied by planning the act for a specific date\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The statement directly indicates an intention to act on the thoughts\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A because the details of the plan are not mentioned, but there is an expressed intent\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A because there's no explicit mention of actions taken or preparations made\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection and given the explicit statement of intent and a planned date, the severity is closer to the highest level due to the expressed intention and planning. Although \"Q6\" is marked as N/A due to lack of explicit preparatory actions, the post's explicit statement of intent and planning (\"Killing myself on the 31st\") aligns more closely with the criteria for the highest severity levels.\n\nThe final severity is determined to be 6 because the individual has explicitly stated their intention to kill themselves on a specific date, indicating a high level of intent and planning. While the exact preparatory actions are not detailed, the statement reflects a clear and specific plan.\n\nThus, adjusting for the closest match based on the criteria and the explicit content of the post:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A but implied\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself\",\n  \"Q3\": \"Implied by planning the act for a specific date\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The statement directly indicates an intention to act on the thoughts\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A because the details of the plan are not mentioned, but there is an expressed intent\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A because there's no explicit mention of actions taken or preparations made\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```"

However, it implies a strong wish not to be alive anymore.  \n   \"Q1\": The post implies a stronger sentiment than just wishing to be dead.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**  \n   The post directly states \"I want to commit suicide,\" indicating thoughts about killing oneself.  \n   \"Q2\": The post directly mentions a desire to commit suicide.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**  \n   The post does not specify any thoughts on the method.  \n   \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no mention of thinking about the method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**  \n   The statement \"I want to commit suicide\" implies an intention or desire to act on these thoughts, though it doesn't directly state an intention to act immediately.  \n   \"Q4\": The post implies a desire that suggests some level of intention.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

However, the implication of a strong desire suggests a level of intent (Severity: 4). There's no evidence of planning or taking action (Severity: 5 or 6).\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied but stronger sentiment\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Directly mentions a desire to commit suicide\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"Implies a desire that suggests some level of intention\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nHowever, upon careful consideration and aligning with the closest criteria, while the direct statement aligns with Severity: 2, the overall implication and the expressed desire to \"commit suicide\" reflect a more serious intent, leaning towards Severity: 4 due to the implication of having thoughts and some level of intention. Therefore, a more nuanced interpretation might consider the severity to be higher due to the explicit nature of the statement.\n\nFor the purpose of this evaluation and following the given instructions strictly, the most directly supported severity is 2. Yet, it's worth noting the post's severity could be argued to be higher due to the explicit expression of a desire to commit suicide.\n\nThus, sticking strictly to the provided scale and the information directly inferable:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied but stronger sentiment\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Directly mentions a desire to commit suicide\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"Implies a desire that suggests some level of intention\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"

The author mentions \"mentioning stuff like death\" but this is in the context of fearing they might say something inappropriate, not indicating they have thoughts of suicide.\n\"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\nThere's no indication in the post that the author has thought about methods of suicide.\n\"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe post does not indicate any intention of acting on suicidal thoughts.\n\"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

It's more about the fear of social rejection and the author's perception of their interactions with others."

While it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead, the toll of their situation could imply a desire to escape, which aligns somewhat with the first criterion. Hence, \"Q1\": is considered somewhat relevant.\n\n2. **Thoughts about killing oneself (Severity: 2):** There's no direct mention or implication of the author having thoughts about killing themselves. Thus, \"Q2\": N/A.\n\n3. **Thinking about how to kill oneself (Severity: 3):** The post doesn't indicate that the author is considering methods of suicide. So, \"Q3\": N/A.\n\n4. **Thoughts with intention of acting on them (Severity: 4):** There's no mention or implication of the author having intentions to act on suicidal thoughts. So, \"Q4\": N/A.\n\n5. **Working out the details of suicide (Severity: 5):** The post doesn't suggest that the author has started to plan or has planned suicide. Thus, \"Q5\": N/A.\n\n6. **Preparing to end one's life (Severity: 6):** The author does not indicate any preparation or action towards ending their life. Hence, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\nGiven the information and the closest match being related to feeling overwhelmed (\"really tolling\") by their situation, which could be interpreted as a form of wishing to escape their current state, the severity is rated as 1, the lowest level of severity according to the scale, as it somewhat aligns with wishing to be dead or not wake up due to the distressing situation described.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is as above, with a \"severity\": 1."

Severity: 1**\nThe post expresses a sense of hopelessness and exhaustion due to being laid off and struggling financially. The statement \"Guess a pathetic end to a pathetic life would wrap it up nicely\" implies a negative sentiment towards their current life situation, which can be interpreted as wishing for an end to their suffering. Thus, it fulfills the criteria for Q1.\n\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe phrase \"I didn't want to end up a statistic but here I am\" followed by \"Guess a pathetic end to a pathetic life would wrap it up nicely\" can be interpreted as having thoughts about ending their life, as it suggests a resignation or acceptance of potentially becoming a statistic (potentially implying suicide statistics). Thus, it suggests thoughts about killing themselves, fulfilling the criteria for Q2.\n\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no direct or indirect indication in the post that the individual has been thinking about the method of ending their life. The statement does not explicitly or implicitly suggest any planning or consideration of how to end their life. Thus, it is N/A for Q3.\n\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post implies a sense of resignation and hopelessness but does not directly indicate an intention to act on thoughts of ending their life. The statement can be seen as a reflection of their despair rather than a clear intention to act. Thus, it is N/A for Q4.\n\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication that the individual has started to work out or has worked out the details of ending their life. Thus, it is N/A for Q5.\n\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not indicate that the individual has taken any action or made preparations to end their life. Thus, it is N/A for Q6.\n\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- Q1 is fulfilled as the post implies a wish for an end to their suffering.\n- Q2 is fulfilled as it suggests thoughts about ending their life.\n- Q3, Q4, Q5, and Q6 are N/A as there's no indication of planning, intending, or preparing to end their life.\n\nThe highest severity level directly supported by the post is 2, as it implies having thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n\nHere is the JSON response based on the analysis:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish for an end to their suffering, suggesting they have wished they were dead or wished to go to sleep and not wake up.\",\n\"Q2\": \"The post suggests thoughts about killing themselves through resignation and acceptance of a potentially tragic outcome.\",\n\"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 2\n}"

It implies a past attempt and a resolve to succeed in a future attempt. So, \"N/A\" for this specific phrasing, but it's clear there's a deeper issue related to suicide.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post implies that the individual has had thoughts about killing themselves since they mention a \"failed attempt\" in the past and a determination to \"succeed\" this time. Thus, \"The post implies past thoughts and a future intention of killing themselves.\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post doesn't explicitly state that the individual has been thinking about the method, but the determination to \"do a better job\" suggests some level of consideration or planning. So, \"The post implies consideration of improving the method for suicide.\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The post clearly indicates an intention to act on these thoughts, as the individual states, \"This time I shall try and do a better job.\" Thus, \"The post shows clear intention of acting on suicidal thoughts.\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - While the post doesn't detail the specifics of the plan, the statement \"This time I shall try and do a better job\" implies a potential for working out or having worked out details. The individual also clearly intends to carry out the plan. So, \"The post implies working out or having worked out details and intending to carry out the plan.\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - The post does not explicitly state that the individual has started or prepared to do anything new to end their life beyond the past attempt. However, the resolve to \"succeed\" this time could imply preparation or intent to act. So, \"N/A directly, but implies potential preparation or intent.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies past thoughts and a future intention of killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post implies consideration of improving the method for suicide.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post shows clear intention of acting on suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post implies working out or having worked out details and intending to carry out the plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A directly, but implies potential preparation or intent.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 6 because, although the post doesn't directly state that the individual has done, started, or prepared something new to end their life, the clear intention, implied planning, and reference to a past attempt with a resolve to \"succeed\" this time suggest a high level of risk. The individual's statement is more aligned with having had a past attempt and intending to act on it again, which corresponds to the highest severity level according to the scale provided."

Thus, **Q3: N/A, as there's no clear indication of planning a method for suicide.**\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\nThe post indicates a strong feeling of being lost and failing in various aspects of life, coupled with the expression that ending everything feels like the only thing they can do.

Thus, **Q5: N/A, as there's no clear indication of planning or intending to carry out a suicide plan.**\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\nThe post mentions self-harm (\"icut unfil ifelf numh\"), which indicates they have done something harmful to themselves, though it's not explicitly aimed at ending their life. This can be considered as having done something that could be related to or perceived as a step towards ending their life. Thus, **Q6: The post indicates self-harm, suggesting they have done something harmful.**\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The post clearly indicates a wish to not be alive or escape suffering (Q1).\n- It suggests having thoughts about killing themselves (Q2).\n- There's an implication of intention or serious consideration of acting on these thoughts (Q4).\n- It mentions self-harm, indicating they have done something harmful (related to Q6).\n\nTherefore, the severity is best represented by the highest level of severity that is supported by the content of the post.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a wish to not be alive or to escape their suffering.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post indicates thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A, as there's no clear indication of planning a method for suicide.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The post implies an intention or serious consideration of acting on suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A, as there's no clear indication of planning or intending to carry out a suicide plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"The post indicates self-harm, suggesting they have done something harmful.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning for a severity score of 6 is based on the indication that the individual has done something harmful to themselves (\"icut unfil ifelf numh\"), which aligns with Q6, despite the action not being explicitly stated as an attempt to end their life. The presence of suicidal ideation, feelings of hopelessness, and self-harm behavior supports a high severity rating."

Thus, \"N/A\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   There's no indication in the post that the individual has considered methods of suicide. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   The post doesn't indicate any thoughts of suicide or intention to act on such thoughts. So, \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   There's no mention or implication of planning or intending to carry out a suicidal act. Thus, \"N/A\".\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   The post does not indicate any action, preparation, or intent to end one's life. It focuses on the lack of friends and feeling like an outcast. So, \"N/A\".\n\nThe overall sentiment of the post is one of loneliness and sadness but not explicitly related to suicidal thoughts or actions as per the Columbia scale. The individual is expressing a desire for social connection and friendship.\n\nGiven the analysis, the severity rating should be **0** because the post, while expressing sadness and loneliness, does not directly relate to suicide or any of the criteria listed in the Columbia scale.\n\nHere's the response in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```"

Thus, \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\n   - The post implies that the individual had thoughts or plans about killing themselves, as they mention tying a noose. Thus, \"Q2\": The action of tying a noose implies thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   - The individual not only thought about it but actually took steps (tying a noose), which is beyond just thinking about how. Thus, \"Q3\": The action indicates they were thinking about how to do it.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   - The post suggests they had intention, as they \"tied a noose,\" indicating a preparation to act.

Thus, **Q1 = The post implies a wish to be dead or not exist**.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** \nThe repeated use of **\"end me\"** can be interpreted as having thoughts about ending one's life, which implies suicidal ideation.

The post does not discuss methods. Thus, **Q3 = N/A**.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?** \nThe intensity and repetition of **\"end me\"** and **\"im fucking horrible\"** suggest a strong emotional state and potentially an intention or a desire to act on these thoughts.

However, the direct question isn't answered, so we'll consider it N/A for now but move to other questions for more insight.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post mentions \"Slit wrists\" and asks if it's painful, which can be seen as having thoughts about a method of killing oneself or at least engaging with the idea.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The specific mention of \"Slit wrists\" as a method indicates thinking about how to potentially end one's life.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The statement \"I guess if I'm asking, I still have hope. But not much.\" can be interpreted as having some level of intention or at least a significant ambivalence towards acting on such thoughts. The acknowledgment of \"not much\" hope could imply a leaning towards acting.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - While the post inquires about the pain associated with slitting wrists, it doesn't explicitly state that they have worked out the details or intend to carry out the plan. However, the interest in the specifics (pain) could be seen as part of planning.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - There's no direct indication in the post that the individual has taken any action or made preparations to end their life.\n\nLet's map this analysis to the JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post mentions a method of suicide, indicating thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post specifically mentions 'Slit wrists', indicating thinking about how to potentially end one's life.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The expression of not having much hope could imply some level of intention or significant ambivalence towards acting on suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A, but the inquiry about pain associated with the method could be seen as related to planning.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A, there's no indication that the individual has taken any action or made preparations to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 3\n}\n```\n\nThe post directly indicates having thoughts about a method of suicide (Severity: 3), but doesn't clearly demonstrate a higher level of severity such as intending to act on these thoughts or preparing to do so. Thus, the overall severity is rated as 3, based on the available information and the most directly relevant questions.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post mentions a method of suicide, indicating thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post specifically mentions 'Slit wrists', indicating thinking about how to potentially end one's life.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The expression of not having much hope could imply some level of intention or significant ambivalence towards acting on suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A, but the inquiry about pain associated with the method could be seen as related to planning.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A, there's no indication that the individual has taken any action or made preparations to end their life.\",\n  \"severity\": 3\n}\n```"

I am feeling just depleted.\"\n\n1. **Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? Severity: 1**\nThe post expresses a feeling of being \"depleted,\" which could be interpreted as a state of emotional or physical exhaustion. While it doesn't directly state a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up, the emotional state described could be related to such feelings. However, it's not explicit. So, \"Q1\": \"The post implies a state of emotional exhaustion that could be related to wishing to escape their current state, but it's not a direct wish to be dead or sleep and not wake up.\"\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post does not directly or indirectly mention thoughts about killing oneself. It simply states a feeling of being depleted. So, \"Q2\": \"N/A\"\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no mention or implication of thinking about methods of suicide. So, \"Q3\": \"N/A\"\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post doesn't indicate any thoughts about suicide or intention to act on such thoughts. So, \"Q4\": \"N/A\"\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication of planning or intending to carry out a suicide plan. So, \"Q5\": \"N/A\"\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post doesn't suggest any action or preparation towards ending one's life. So, \"Q6\": \"N/A\"\n\nGiven the information and the feelings expressed in the post, while it does convey a negative emotional state (\"feeling just depleted\"), it doesn't directly indicate or imply suicidal thoughts or intentions as per the questions. Therefore, the severity should be evaluated based on the closest relevant metric.\n\nSince the post conveys a significant level of distress (\"feeling just depleted\"), which might be associated with a wish to escape their current emotional state, but doesn't directly align with any of the specific criteria, the closest interpretation is related to the first question. However, it's still not a clear \"wish to be dead.\"\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The post implies a state of emotional exhaustion that could be related to wishing to escape their current state, but it's not a direct wish to be dead or sleep and not wake up.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThis assignment is based on the interpretation that the post's expression of feeling \"depleted\" is the closest to indicating a potential wish to escape their current state, aligning with the spirit of the first question, albeit not directly. The severity is thus rated as 1, the lowest level of severity that still acknowledges some level of distress, even though it doesn't directly fulfill the criteria for Severity: 1."

Severity: 1**\n   - The post does not directly or indirectly express a wish to be dead or to go to sleep and not wake up.

So, \"Q1\": N/A.\n\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The post explicitly states, \"I'm not suicidal,\" indicating the absence of suicidal thoughts. Thus, \"Q2\": N/A.\n\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - Since the individual denies being suicidal, this question is not directly relevant.

So, \"Q3\": N/A in the context of suicide.\n\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - Again, the context is about self-harm rather than suicide.

Hence, \"Q6\": N/A.\n\n\nThe post is about self-harm, not directly about suicide. However, the desire to self-harm (\"cut my arms so deep\") indicates a significant level of distress. While it doesn't fit neatly into the Columbia scale for suicide severity, the expressed intent to self-harm is a serious concern. The severity level based on the provided scale is not directly applicable, but given the context, we could argue for a severity score based on the closest related concern (self-harm) rather than suicide.\n\n\nGiven the closest metrics and context:\n- The individual is not suicidal but expresses a desire to self-harm.\n- There's a cry for help.\n\n\nResponse in JSON format using the provided template:\n\n{\n\"Q1\": N/A,\n\"Q2\": N/A,\n\"Q3\": N/A,\n\"Q4\": N/A,\n\"Q5\": N/A,\n\"Q6\": N/A,\n\"severity\": 0\n}\n\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that while the severity is rated as 0 based on the provided scale focusing on suicide, the post indicates a need for intervention due to self-harm intentions. Practitioners should consider assessing for self-harm severity or risk separately."

Severity: 1**\nThe post states, \"New Year's Eve is another day that makes me want to end it.\" This implies a desire to end their life, which is more severe than just wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up. However, the initial part of the post mentions being on a platform on Christmas and feeling sad, which could imply a negative emotional state. So, while there's a mention of sadness and not feeling happy, the direct statement about wanting to \"end it\" on New Year's Eve is more relevant to higher severity questions.

Severity: 3**\nThere's no mention of how they might kill themselves; they only express thoughts about it.\n\n   - \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no mention of thinking about the method.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe user indicates they are thinking about suicide but also states, \"Thinking of suicide everyday isn't gonna help me, I know,\" which suggests a recognition that acting on these thoughts is not helpful.

Thus, it aligns with wishing to be dead. \n   - \"Q1\": The user implies a wish to be dead or leave their current state.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The user is contemplating methods of suicide (using firearms, a knife, suffocation), indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves.\n   - \"Q2\": The post directly mentions having thoughts about killing oneself through various methods.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The post lists specific methods the user has considered (firearms, knife, suffocation), showing they have thought about how to kill themselves.\n   - \"Q3\": The user has considered specific methods of suicide.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The user seems to be expressing a desire to act but is hesitant due to various reasons (lack of means, fear, or being \"too much of a pussy\").

Thus, \"Q1\": N/A.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\nThe post does not explicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself.

Thus, **\"Q1\": \"The user mentions 'I already wanted to', suggesting a wish to be dead or not wake up.\"**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The statement \"I already wanted to\" implies a thought about ending one's life or a desire to die, but it's not explicit about killing oneself.

Thus, **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"** because it doesn't directly indicate an action or preparation to end their life.\n\nGiven this analysis, the post's language most closely aligns with **\"Q1\"** due to the expression of a wish to be dead (\"I already wanted to\").

So, this criteria is fulfilled.\n   \"Q1\": The statement implies a death wish.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The post does not directly mention thoughts about killing oneself but implies a sense of not being supposed to be alive. However, it can be inferred that there's a contemplation about one's own death or existence. \n   \"Q2\": Implied, as the sentiment suggests a form of self-destructive or nihilistic thinking.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   There's no specific mention of how to end one's life or any method. \n   \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   The post expresses a feeling of not knowing how to \"survive the rest of this life,\" which indicates distress but not a clear intention to act on suicidal thoughts.\n   \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   There's no mention of working out details or having a plan to end one's life.\n   \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   The post does not indicate any action or preparation towards ending one's life.\n   \"Q6\": N/A\n\nThe post directly fulfills the criteria for Q1 with its expression of wishing to have died earlier. It implies a form of suicidal ideation (Q2) due to the sentiment of feeling like one shouldn't be alive and questioning how to continue living. However, it doesn't directly indicate any specific plans or actions (Q3-Q6).\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and the scale:\n\n- The post is related to suicidal ideation, directly fulfilling Q1 and implying a possible fulfillment of Q2 due to the context.\n\nGiven the direct expression of a death wish and the implication of suicidal ideation without a clear plan or action, the severity is evaluated as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The statement implies a death wish.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Implied, as the sentiment suggests a form of self-destructive or nihilistic thinking.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 2 because the post directly indicates a wish to be dead (Severity: 1) and implies having thoughts about one's own death or existence in a way that could be interpreted as related to killing oneself (Severity: 2), but it doesn't provide evidence for the higher severity levels."

Severity: 1**\nThe post doesn't directly mention wishing to be dead or sleep without waking up. However, it expresses feelings of sadness, rejection, and low self-esteem due to a perceived slight from a friend. The emotional distress is evident, but there's no explicit mention of wishing to be dead. Thus, \"N/A\" for this criterion.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe post is about feeling paranoid, having a panic attack, and feeling undervalued by a friend. There's no direct mention or implication of thoughts about killing oneself. So, \"N/A\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nSince there's no indication of suicidal thoughts (from Q2), this criterion doesn't apply. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nAgain, there's no mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or intentions.

Severity: 6**\nThe post doesn't indicate any actions or preparations towards ending one's life. So, \"N/A\".\n\n\nGiven the information and the emotional distress described, the post is more related to feelings of rejection, low self-esteem, and the emotional challenges of living with schizophrenia rather than expressing suicidal ideation or intent.

So, the sentiment is related but not directly answering this question.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A (Though implied, it's not directly addressed)\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The user directly mentions \"Should I just k.ll myself?\" and \"I'm planning to try doing it again,\" which indicates they have had thoughts about killing themselves.\n   - \"Q2\": The statement \"Should I just k.ll myself?\" and \"I'm planning to try doing it again\" fulfills this criterion.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post doesn't explicitly state that they've been thinking about the method, but the fact that they're planning to \"try doing it again\" suggests some level of consideration or planning.\n   - \"Q3\": The phrase \"I'm planning to try doing it again\" implies some thought on the action, though the method isn't specified.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The user states, \"I'm planning to try doing it again,\" which clearly indicates an intention to act on their thoughts.\n   - \"Q4\": The statement \"I'm planning to try doing it again\" fulfills this criterion.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

Thus, **Q5: Took a significant overdose, indicating some level of planning and intent.**\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post explicitly states they took a significant overdose, which means they did something to end their life. Thus, **Q6: Took a significant overdose.**\n\nGiven these observations, the JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"Implied a wish to not be alive or end their life.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"Explicitly mentioned having thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"Took an overdose, indicating they thought about how to end their life.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"Took actions that show intention to end their life.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"Took a significant overdose, indicating some level of planning and intent.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"Took a significant overdose.\",\n  \"severity\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 6 because the user took a significant overdose, directly indicating they have done something to end their life, which aligns with the criteria for the highest severity level on the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE."

Severity: 4**\n   The statement \"Want to kill myself\" implies an intention.

The severity is rated as 4 because, while there's no explicit planning or action, the user's expression of suicidal thoughts and the lack of emotional response to the potential consequences of their death on loved ones (pets and family) suggest a significant level of intent or resignation."

This goes beyond just wishing to be dead or sleep and not wake up, but it's worth noting the presence of a death wish. So, while this is present, it's not the most severe statement made. \"Q1\": N/A because it goes beyond this level.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?** The user directly states \"I JUST WANT TO KILL MYSELF PLEASE\", indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves. \"Q2\": The user explicitly mentions a desire to kill themselves.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?** There's no information in the post about the user thinking about the method to kill themselves. \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?** The direct statement \"I JUST WANT TO KILL MYSELF PLEASE\" is followed by \"So yeah that's it\", which could imply a level of resignation or finality, but it doesn't clearly indicate an intention to act. \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?** There's no mention of working out details of a plan. \"Q5\": N/A\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?** There's no indication in the post that the user has taken any action towards ending their life. \"Q6\": N/A\n\nGiven the explicit statement \"I JUST WANT TO KILL MYSELF PLEASE\", the user has clearly had thoughts about killing themselves, aligning with Severity: 2. However, the explicit desire and the context (the user reaching out for help) might suggest a higher level of distress.\n\nThe response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user explicitly mentions a desire to kill themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation considers the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts as the most relevant factor. While the user's expression of distress and desire to kill themselves is severe, the post does not provide evidence of planning or attempting to act on these thoughts, which are necessary for higher severity scores according to the scale."

Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" - There's no mention of working out details or intending to carry out a plan.\n   - \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no discussion of planning or intending to act.\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" - The post does not mention any actions taken or preparations made to end their life.\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no indication of taking action.\n\nDespite the absence of direct evidence for questions 2 through 6, the severity of the post is significantly high due to the expressed long-standing wish to be dead and the feeling of having no other options or hope for improvement. The statement \"Nothing helps\" and \"I've done everything this life has to offer and it's all been clouded by despair and self-loathing\" indicates a deep despair.\n\nGiven the information and the criteria, the most relevant answer is tied to \"Q1\" as it directly relates to wishing to be dead. However, the overall tone and content suggest a high level of distress.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user has expressed a long-standing wish to be dead.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nHowever, considering the context and the overall severity implied by the long duration and depth of the feelings expressed, one might argue the severity is higher. Yet, based strictly on the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics provided and the information directly available from the post, the most directly supported severity level is 1 due to the explicit mention of wishing to be dead. The overall severity and the implications of the post could suggest a need for a more nuanced evaluation that considers the intensity and duration of the feelings expressed. Still, adhering strictly to the provided metrics and their corresponding severities, the response is constrained to the available data. \n\nThus, while the post indicates a profound level of distress and a long history of suicidal ideation at the level of wishing to be dead, the strict application of the scale results in a severity rating of 1. For a comprehensive assessment, additional context and a more detailed evaluation by a professional would be necessary. \n\nTherefore, based on the given scale and the information directly inferable:\n \n\"severity\": 1"

Thus, it indicates a wish to be dead. \n   - \"Q1\": The post implies a desire to escape or die with someone, so it fulfills this criterion.\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" - The metaphor \"drink the koolaid\" is often associated with a collective or joint action that involves giving up one's life or a significant part of oneself. While it's not a direct statement about killing oneself, it implies a serious consideration of ending one's life together with someone else.\n   - \"Q2\": The post implies thoughts that could be related to killing oneself, so it somewhat fulfills this criterion.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - The post does not explicitly outline a plan but references \"drink the koolaid,\" which can imply a method (though not specified, it is often associated with Jim Jones' mass suicide, where members drank a poisoned drink).\n   - \"Q3\": While the method is implied rather than directly stated, there is a hint towards a method.\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The expression of wanting to \"drink the koolaid\" with someone indicates a certain level of intent or desire, suggesting that the thought is not just passive.\n   - \"Q4\": The desire to act is present in the sentiment expressed.\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

It is a request to talk to someone, which could be interpreted as seeking help or support but doesn't directly imply a wish to be dead. So, \"N/A\" for this specific criteria as it doesn't directly relate to the content.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\n   - The post does not explicitly or implicitly mention thoughts about killing oneself. It's a plea for conversation. Thus, \"N/A\".\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\n   - There's no indication in the post about thinking about methods of suicide. Hence, \"N/A\".\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\n   - The post does not mention having thoughts about suicide or any intention to act on them. Therefore, \"N/A\".\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?

Severity: 6**\n   - The post is a request for conversation and does not indicate any action towards ending one's life. Thus, \"N/A\".\n\nThe overall severity is not directly related to any of the specific questions being affirmatively answered. However, the act of asking to talk to someone can be seen as a cry for help, which might imply some level of distress. Despite this, without more context indicating suicidal ideation or intent, the severity level based on the provided scale would be considered as not directly related to suicide.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation is based on the information given and the context of the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE.

Severity: 1**\nThe post expresses a state of extreme tiredness and not having slept in a long time, but it doesn't directly indicate wishing to be dead or sleep without waking up. However, the overall sentiment could imply a deep desire to escape their current state. The statement \"I'm a coward for not ending it all\" suggests a more severe sentiment than just wishing to sleep and not wake up. So, while it's related, the specific wish is not directly stated, but it's leaning towards a more severe expression.\n\n   \"Q1\": N/A (The sentiment is more severe than just wishing to be dead or sleep without waking.)\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe phrase \"I'm a coward for not ending it all\" implies that the person has considered ending their life. This suggests they have had thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n   \"Q2\": The statement \"I'm a coward for not ending it all\" implies having thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no indication in the post about how they might end their life. The statement is about not taking action rather than planning it.\n\n   \"Q3\": N/A (There's no mention of thinking about the method.)\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nThe post implies self-blame for not acting on their thoughts (\"I'm a coward for not ending it all\"), suggesting some level of consideration or intention, but it's not clear if it's a firm intention.\n\n   \"Q4\": The implication is there, as the person feels they are a coward for not acting.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no evidence in the post that they have worked out the details of a plan.\n\n   \"Q5\": N/A (No mention of working out details or having a plan.)\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThe post does not indicate that they have taken any actions towards ending their life.\n\n   \"Q6\": N/A (No indication of taking action or preparing to end their life.)\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The post implies having thoughts about killing themselves (\"I'm a coward for not ending it all\"), which aligns with **Q2**.\n- It suggests some level of intention or self-blame for not acting on these thoughts, which can be related to **Q4**.\n\nThe most relevant severity level based on the provided information is **Q2** because it directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself. However, the expression of being a \"coward for not ending it all\" also brings it close to indicating an intention (Q4), but without clear evidence of a plan or action.\n\nTherefore, the severity is best rated as **4**, because while they have had thoughts about killing themselves and there's an implication of some intention or consideration of acting on these thoughts (due to feeling like a coward for not doing so), there's no clear evidence of having worked out the details or taken actions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The statement 'I'm a coward for not ending it all' implies having thoughts about killing oneself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The implication is there, as the person feels they are a coward for not acting.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

It implies a plan to end life after a specific event, so it goes beyond just wishing to be dead. Hence, \"N/A\" for this specific criteria, but it's worth noting the post implies a more severe intent.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post implies that the author has thought about ending their life (\"i already got it figured out\"). Thus, it can be inferred that the author has had thoughts about killing themselves. So, \"Q2\": The post implies thoughts of killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The author mentions \"i already got it figured out,\" which directly indicates they have been thinking about how to end their life.

While it implies preparation, there's no explicit statement of having done or started to do anything to end their life, which would be required for a severity rating of 6."

Severity: 3**\n   There's no indication that the author is thinking about methods of suicide or any plans related to ending their life. The post is about ensuring the child's financial security.

Severity: 2**\nThe phrase \"don't have the courage to die either\" suggests that the person has considered dying but lacks the courage to act on it, implying thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n\"Q2\": The mention of \"don't have the courage to die\" implies they have had thoughts about dying/killing themselves.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?

Therefore, while it's a concerning post due to the emotional distress expressed, it doesn't directly fulfill any of the criteria listed for severity levels 1 through 6.\n\nResponse in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\nThis response reflects that the post does not directly indicate suicidal ideation or behavior according to the provided metrics, hence a severity score of 0. However, it's worth noting that the post still indicates a need for support."

I just want to die.\" This indicates a strong wish to not be alive, fulfilling the criteria for Severity: 1.\n\n   \"Q1\": The user explicitly expresses a wish to die.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post states, \"I (23F) am killing myself tonight.\" This directly indicates thoughts about killing herself and a clear intention to do so, fulfilling and exceeding the criteria for Severity: 2.\n\n   \"Q2\": The user explicitly states an intention to kill herself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - The post details a specific plan: \"My goal is to take a handful of my trazodone (50mg each) and get in the bath and hopefully fall asleep and drown.\" This shows a clear thought process on how to end her life, fulfilling the criteria for Severity: 3.\n\n   \"Q3\": The user outlines a specific method for ending her life.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The statement \"I (23F) am killing myself tonight\" coupled with a detailed plan indicates a clear intention to act on these thoughts, fulfilling the criteria for Severity: 4.\n\n   \"Q4\": The user's statement and detailed plan show intention to act.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - The post outlines a specific plan with details (\"take a handful of my trazodone (50mg each) and get in the bath and hopefully fall asleep and drown\"), indicating that the details have been worked out. The intention to carry out the plan is also clear (\"I am killing myself tonight\"), fulfilling the criteria for Severity: 5.\n\n   \"Q5\": The user has worked out the details and intends to carry out the plan.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?**\n   - While the post does not explicitly state that she has started or prepared to end her life at the moment of writing, the detailed plan and statement of intent (\"I am killing myself tonight\") strongly imply preparation or intention to start the act soon. However, it does not directly state that she has taken tangible steps like taking the trazodone at the time of posting.\n\n   \"Q6\": N/A (There's no clear indication that she has started or prepared to end her life at the moment of posting, though it's implied she's about to.)\n\nGiven the above analysis, the severity is best categorized based on the closest matching criteria. The user has explicitly stated an intention to kill herself, detailed a plan, and expressed a clear wish to die. The most severe action described is having a detailed plan and intending to carry it out (Severity: 5). However, the post implies an imminent action (\"tonight\"), suggesting a high level of severity.\n\nTherefore, the response in JSON format, considering the detailed plan and the intention to act on it immediately, is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user explicitly expresses a wish to die.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user explicitly states an intention to kill herself.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The user outlines a specific method for ending her life.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user's statement and detailed plan show intention to act.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The user has worked out the details and intends to carry out the plan.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThis categorization reflects the detailed planning and stated intention to end her life, making Severity: 5 the most appropriate rating. Severity: 6 would require evidence that she has started or prepared to end her life, which is not explicitly stated in the post, though it's a very close call given the context and immediacy of the threat."

Thus, \"Q1\": The post implies a wish to be dead or not wake up.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   The statement \"knowing that I have found a solution to end my self\" directly implies having thoughts about killing oneself. So, \"Q2\": The post indicates thoughts about killing oneself.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   The phrase \"found a solution to end my self\" suggests that the individual has thought about how to end their life.

However, the individual expresses feeling anxious and back into a negative state after having felt better. Thus, it doesn't directly fulfill this criterion, but there's an underlying distress.\n   - \"Q1\": N/A\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** Severity: 2\n   - The post doesn't directly state having thoughts about killing oneself. The language used is more about feeling anxious and mentally weak, and a realization of not being better as perceived by others.\n   - \"Q2\": N/A\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** Severity: 3\n   - There's no indication in the post that the individual has been thinking about methods of suicide.\n   - \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** Severity: 4\n   - The post doesn't explicitly mention having thoughts of suicide or any intention to act on them.\n   - \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

They've stopped therapy and feel the need to be honest about their state, contrasting with how others perceive them. While there's an expression of distress and a feeling of not being okay, there's no direct indication of suicidal ideation or intent as per the C-SSRS metrics.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the C-SSRS scale, the post's severity is evaluated as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": N/A,\n  \"Q2\": N/A,\n  \"Q3\": N/A,\n  \"Q4\": N/A,\n  \"Q5\": N/A,\n  \"Q6\": N/A,\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 0 because, although the post indicates the individual is experiencing mental health distress and feeling overwhelmed, it does not directly relate to or indicate suicidal ideation or behavior as defined by the C-SSRS metrics."

However, the initial part of the question is somewhat related to their sentiment, so we'll consider it.\n\n   - \"Q1\": The user is expressing a desire to be killed, which is related but more severe than just wishing to be dead.\n\n2. **\"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\"** (Severity: 2)\nThe post doesn't directly indicate thoughts about killing themselves; instead, it mentions wishing to be killed by someone else.\n\n   - \"Q2\": N/A, as the thoughts are about being killed by someone else, not about self-killing.\n\n3. **\"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\"** (Severity: 3)\nThere's no indication in the post about thinking about methods to kill themselves.\n\n   - \"Q3\": N/A, since there's no mention of contemplating methods for self-killing.\n\n4. **\"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\"** (Severity: 4)\nThe post doesn't directly indicate an intention to act on the wish to be killed.\n\n   - \"Q4\": N/A, as there's no clear indication of having intentions to act on these thoughts.\n\n5. **\"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\"** (Severity: 5)\nThe post does not mention working out details or planning to kill themselves.\n\n   - \"Q5\": N/A, since there's no mention of planning or intending to carry out a self-killing plan.\n\n6. **\"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\"** (Severity: 6)\nThe user explicitly states they are \"not actively trying to unalive myself,\" indicating no action towards ending their life.\n\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as they state not actively trying to end their life.\n\nGiven the user's expression of wishing to be killed and feeling glad in dreams when something or someone kills them, it indicates a significant level of distress. Although it doesn't directly fit into the categories related to self-killing, the sentiment expressed is severe and related to a desire not to be alive.\n\nThe closest related severity is **1**, as it involves wishing not to be alive (\"wish someone just please kill me\"), but the nature of the wish is more severe and disturbing.\n\nThe JSON response is:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user is expressing a desire to be killed, which is related but more severe than just wishing to be dead.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 1\n}\n```\n\nHowever, given the context and the specific phrasing of the questions focusing on self-inflicted actions or thoughts, the severity might be considered in the context of the user's overall mental state and the severity of their expressed wishes. The exact match to the scale isn't perfect due to the nature of the user's statement (wishing to be killed vs. self-killing). Still, it indicates a level of distress.\n\nTo directly follow the provided instructions without implying a higher severity than directly supported by the text, the response is kept as is, focusing on the closest matching criteria. For a more nuanced evaluation, clinical judgment considering the full context and potential underlying issues would be necessary."

However, it suggests a significant level of distress that could be interpreted as having some thoughts about ending one's life.\n   \"Q2\": The post implies a desire not to be alive, which can be related to thoughts of killing oneself, but it's not explicit.\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" - There's no information in the post about thinking about the method to end one's life.\n   \"Q3\": N/A\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" - The post doesn't explicitly mention an intention to act on the thoughts of not wanting to be alive.\n   \"Q4\": N/A\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?

However, it's worth noting that interpreting the exact severity can depend on the context and the interpreter's understanding of the language used. The direct statement \"i dont want to be alive anymore\" is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation, aligning with a severity of at least 1 and potentially 2 due to its implications."

However, there's no clear indication that they have a plan or intend to carry it out. \"Q5\": The post shows some exploration of the details but lacks a clear plan or intention.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\n   - There's no indication that the person has taken any action or made preparations to end their life. \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no evidence of action or preparation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the response in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The post implies the person has had thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"The post directly asks about a specific method of suicide.\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"The post shows some exploration of the details but lacks a clear plan or intention.\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 3\n}\n```\n\nThe post's severity is rated as 3 because it directly indicates thinking about how to kill oneself by inquiring about a specific method (jumping from a certain height). While it suggests some level of contemplation on the method, it doesn't clearly indicate an intention to act or any preparation to end one's life."

        "llama_response": "To evaluate the post according to the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics, let's break down the post step by step.\n\n1. The user mentions that their depression and anxiety were triggered \"very very badly,\" indicating a significant level of distress.\n2. They've tried several coping mechanisms (journaling, taking a nap, trying to focus on something else) but are still feeling unwell, suggesting that their condition is severe enough that usual self-help methods are not effective.\n3. The user describes feeling \"so angry and sad\" that they feel \"physically ill,\" which highlights the intensity of their emotional pain.\n4. The user is reaching out for someone to talk to, indicating a desire for support.\n\nNow, evaluating the post against the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE metrics:\n\n- \"Q1: Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?\" The user does not directly express a wish to be dead or to sleep and not wake up, so \"N/A\".\n- \"Q2: Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" There's no direct mention or implication of thoughts about killing themselves, so \"N/A\".\n- \"Q3: Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" Not applicable as there's no indication of thoughts about killing themselves, so \"N/A\".\n- \"Q4: Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" Again, not applicable due to the lack of indication of suicidal thoughts, so \"N/A\".\n- \"Q5: Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" Not applicable, so \"N/A\".\n- \"Q6: Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" There's no indication of this, so \"N/A\".\n\nDespite the lack of direct suicidal ideation or intent in the post, the user's emotional state is clearly very distressed. However, according to the given metrics and the information provided in the post, the severity should be evaluated based on the explicit criteria.\n\nGiven that the user is reaching out for support and there's no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts or intentions, but the overall distress is significant, we still need to score based on the explicit criteria provided.\n\nThe response in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe severity is rated as 0 because the post does not directly relate to any of the specific criteria for suicidal ideation or behavior as outlined in the COLUMBIA-SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE. However, it's worth noting that the user is clearly in distress and is seeking support, which is an important aspect of mental health support."

Thus, **\"Q1\": \"The user expresses a desire to not continue living, fulfilling this criterion.\"**\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?**\n   - The post mentions, \"suicide is my last chance at dignity.\" This directly indicates that the user has had thoughts about killing themselves as a viable option. Thus, **\"Q2\": \"The user explicitly mentions suicide as an option, indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves.\"**\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this?**\n   - While the post does not explicitly state that the user has been thinking about the method of suicide, the fact that they mention \"suicide is my last chance at dignity\" without elaborating on the method might suggest that they are at least considering it. However, there's no clear indication they have been thinking about how to do it. Thus, **\"Q3\": \"N/A\"** because there's no direct evidence.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?**\n   - The statement \"I am done\" followed by \"I don't want to continue living in this shitty reality anymore\" and considering \"suicide is my last chance at dignity\" implies a certain level of intention or consideration towards acting on these thoughts. Thus, **\"Q4\": \"The user's statements suggest a level of intention or resignation that could imply an intention to act on their suicidal thoughts.\"**\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?**\n   - There's no explicit mention of working out the details of a suicide plan in the post.

Thus, **\"Q6\": \"N/A\"** because there's no direct evidence.\n\n**Severity Assessment:**\nBased on the provided information and analysis:\n- The user has expressed a wish to not be alive (**Q1** fulfilled).\n- They have had thoughts about killing themselves (**Q2** fulfilled).\n- There's an implication of intention to act on these thoughts (**Q4** fulfilled to some extent).\n\nGiven this, the highest fulfilled criterion directly mentioned is having thoughts about killing oneself and some level of intention. The direct expression of considering \"suicide is my last chance at dignity\" aligns most closely with a severity of **4**, as it indicates having thoughts and some intention of acting on them.\n\nThus, the JSON response is:\n```json\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses a desire to not continue living, fulfilling this criterion.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user explicitly mentions suicide as an option, indicating they have had thoughts about killing themselves.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"The user's statements suggest a level of intention or resignation that could imply an intention to act on their suicidal thoughts.\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 4\n}\n```"

However, it implies a more severe condition by mentioning considering an attempt. So, it's likely that the individual has had such wishes, but it's not directly stated. Thus, \"Q1\": N/A (because it's not directly stated but implied to be beyond this level)\n\n\n2. \"Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself?\" (Severity: 2)\nThe individual is \"considering attempting soon,\" which directly implies having thoughts about killing themselves. So, \"Q2\": The post implies the individual has had thoughts about killing themselves.\n\n\n3. \"Have you been thinking about how you might do this?\" (Severity: 3)\nThe post doesn't explicitly state that they have been thinking about how to do it, but they are concerned about the consequences of failing an attempt, suggesting some level of planning or consideration. So, \"Q3\": The concern about failing an attempt implies some thought about the method or consequences.\n\n\n4. \"Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?\" (Severity: 4)\nThe individual is \"considering attempting soon,\" which strongly suggests they have an intention of acting on these thoughts. So, \"Q4\": The post clearly indicates an intention to act.\n\n\n5. \"Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan?\" (Severity: 5)\nThe post doesn't directly state that they have worked out the details, but the concern about the consequences of failing an attempt implies some level of consideration. The intention to carry out the plan is present as they are \"considering attempting soon.\" So, \"Q5\": While not explicitly stated, the consideration and intention imply a level of planning.\n\n\n6. \"Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?\" (Severity: 6)\nThe post doesn't directly state that they have done, started, or prepared to do anything to end their life, but they are asking about the consequences and procedures related to attempting suicide, indicating they are close to taking action or considering it seriously. So, \"Q6\": N/A (as there's no direct evidence they've taken action)\n\n\nGiven these assessments, the post directly indicates that the individual is considering attempting suicide soon and is concerned about the consequences of failing, which aligns with having thoughts about killing themselves and some intention of acting on them.\n\n\nHere is the JSON response based on the assessment:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": N/A,\n\"Q2\": The post implies the individual has had thoughts about killing themselves,\n\"Q3\": The concern about failing an attempt implies some thought about the method or consequences,\n\"Q4\": The post clearly indicates an intention to act,\n\"Q5\": N/A (though intention is present, detailed planning isn't explicitly mentioned),\n\"Q6\": N/A,\n\"severity\": 4\n}\n\n\nThe severity is rated as 4 because the individual has expressed a clear intention to act on their suicidal thoughts (\"considering attempting soon\"), directly fulfilling the criteria for Severity: 4."

Severity: 1**\nThe post contains the phrase \"I dont see any point in life in last few years\" which implies a sense of hopelessness and could be interpreted as wishing to not be alive or to escape their current state. The tone is somewhat veiled but suggests a deep dissatisfaction with life.\n\n   - \"Q1\": The user expresses not seeing the point in life, which can be associated with wishing they were dead or not wanting to wake up.\n\n2. **Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? Severity: 2**\nThe statement \"I think i will not made to 2026\" can be interpreted as the user not expecting to be alive by then, which indirectly suggests they might be having thoughts about their own mortality or possibly suicidal ideation.\n\n   - \"Q2\": The user's statement about not making it to 2026 could imply they have thoughts about their own death or not being alive.\n\n3. **Have you been thinking about how you might do this? Severity: 3**\nThere's no explicit mention or implication of the user thinking about the method of suicide.\n\n   - \"Q3\": N/A, as there's no mention of how they might end their life.\n\n4. **Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? Severity: 4**\nWhile the post suggests a sense of despair and a possible inclination towards not being alive, it doesn't directly indicate an intention to act on these thoughts. The tone, especially with the emoji \"\ud83d\ude03\", is somewhat ambiguous, making it difficult to ascertain the level of intent.\n\n   - \"Q4\": N/A, as there's no clear indication of intention to act on their thoughts.\n\n5. **Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Did you intend to carry out this plan? Severity: 5**\nThere's no indication that the user has started to work out the details of a plan.\n\n   - \"Q5\": N/A, as there's no mention of working out details.\n\n6. **Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Severity: 6**\nThere's no indication that the user has taken any action or prepared to end their life.\n\n   - \"Q6\": N/A, as there's no evidence of preparation or action towards ending their life.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- The post implies a sense of hopelessness and a possible wish not to be alive (\"Q1\" is applicable).\n- It suggests the user might be having thoughts about not being alive or dying (\"Q2\" is somewhat applicable).\n\nHowever, there's a lack of clear indication regarding the specifics of suicidal ideation or actions beyond a general sense of despair and not expecting to be alive in the future.\n\nThus, the severity is not 0 because the post is somewhat related to suicidal ideation or at least a sense of significant distress. It seems most closely aligned with Severity: 2, as there's an implication of having thoughts about not being alive.\n\nHere is the response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Q1\": \"The user expresses not seeing the point in life, which can be associated with wishing they were dead or not wanting to wake up.\",\n  \"Q2\": \"The user's statement about not making it to 2026 could imply they have thoughts about their own death or not being alive.\",\n  \"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n  \"severity\": 2\n}\n```"
