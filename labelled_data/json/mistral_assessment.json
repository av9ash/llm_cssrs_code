Trust me, a infection is by far the worst way to go out.

I hate that im here,\" which indicates a wish to be dead or not wake up, corresponding to Severity 1.\n- The phrase \"I just want to be gone\" also suggests thoughts about killing oneself, corresponding to Severity 2.\n- There is no mention of thinking about how to do this, having intentions to act on these thoughts, working out details, or preparing to do anything to end life, so Severities 3-6 are not applicable."

I am looking for anything to help me function as a normal adult, even if that means getting addicted to something to help. For background, I'm diagnosed with every anxiety disorder (even the debatable ones) and medicated for it. I have adhd as well, so i take adderall everyday for that too.  I've tried eliminating that to help, but I have to have it for the adhd. Please help.",
