There is many risks like infection, social stigma, nerve damage and others. Especially infection is a big one because I am pretty sure that most people who self harm don't use sterile blades. Trust me, a infection is by far the worst way to go out. You will hate yourself more if you self harm, try to be with people, you don't have to talk all the time because just being with them will greatly reduce the urge to self harm.",

I'm still alive, i haven't slept for almost two days though. the thing is i don't WANT to die... but if i keep having these lows i will. I don't want to leave my bf/ brother/mom/ little sister behind either, but at this point i've just become a burden to them :( ",

I hate this capitalist echo chamber, nothing ever feels real and I've never longed for anything else. With my countries constant state of financial crisis, it looks like it's far away.

It's so common to always see bad news on the internet, but the death of the CEO of UHG made me realize there's still hope for humanity. There's still people fighting and making extremes to find justice. I don't condone violence, but I see the shooter must have dealt with a lot of pain before doing something drastic like this. It brought me to tears.   \r\n  \r\nI feel stronger now. I feel I want to live until next year. I belive maybe things will be better. For real this time.  I feel hope for the first time in months. ",

I told my girlfriend that I have been feeling suicidal but had been hiding it because I thought I had moved past these thoughts I've had in the past.

It feels like she is making it about herself but I see her perspective as well. I love her dearly and care about her so much. But that doesn't dictate whether I want to end my life or not.",

If you ever think you might act on these thoughts or you\u2019re in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number (for example, 911 in the U.S.) or go to the nearest hospital. If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can also reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by calling 988. If you\u2019re outside the U.S., you can find international hotlines here: https://findahelpline.com/, or you can do an online search for a local crisis helpline in your country. If calling isn\u2019t an option, you might try a crisis text line; in the U.S., you can text HOME to 741741. Talking with someone right now could make a difference, even if just to let some of this pain out.

Hi All,\n\nI am wondering if there is a way to protect my therapists in case I do lose my battle to depression. \n\nI have a handful of providers that create my treatment team due to an eating disorder. I'm doing much better in that department, but my depression and anxiety have skyrocketed yet again. I'm done. This isn't a life and idk how much longer I can last. \n\nI recently went inpatient for SI with intent. I got out after two weeks and I'm terrified to go back. I always hate being in the mental hospital. My primary therapist brought up liability and I don't want her or anyone else to get in legal trouble because of me. ",

I feel like I just need someone to talk to but lately it's so hard for me to open up. I feel like the reason I haven't committed suicide is because when I think about doing it , it sounds so selfish to do that to everyone I love and then I start thinking about my boyfriend finding my lifeless body in the middle of our bedroom. I'm just tired of crying myself to sleep and thinking about how useless I am. ",

Nothing can make me stop feeling horrible. I'll do it as soon as I hide enough pills away from the eyes of my mother. I'm just so tired of trying to pretend like something will get better when it proves wrong again and again. I just don't care anymore.",
