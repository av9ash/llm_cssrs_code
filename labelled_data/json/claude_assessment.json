Let me analyze it step by step:\n\nThe post states: \"If anyone could listen to what s happening in my life and tell me the options. I would gladly talk to them before anything happens. Add meee .\"\n\n1) The person is seeking help and wanting to talk about their situation.\n2) They mention \"before anything happens\" which is vague but implies some potential negative action.\n3) There is no explicit mention of suicide or self-harm.\n4) The person seems to be reaching out for support rather than announcing a plan.\n5) The overall tone suggests distress but not imminent suicide risk.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 0\n}\n\n\nThe post shows someone in distress seeking help, but there is no specific reference to suicide or self-harm. The phrase \"before anything happens\" is too vague to definitively indicate suicidal thoughts. While the person clearly needs support, the content doesn't meet the specific criteria for any of the suicide severity questions."

The expression \"i hate everything\" suggests a level of despair that warrants a severity rating of 1.

I am tired. Brachial or perpetual exhaustion?\"\n\nStep 1: Analyze key terms and meaning\n- \"Open the brachial\" likely refers to cutting or opening the brachial artery, which is a method of suicide\n- The person presents this as an alternative to \"keep trying\" and contrasts it with \"perpetual exhaustion\"\n- This suggests they're considering self-harm as an escape from ongoing struggle\n\nStep 2: Assess against each CSSRS question\n- Q1: The mention of being \"tired\" and \"perpetual exhaustion\" implies wishing to escape life's difficulties\n- Q2: The post explicitly considers a potential method of suicide (opening the brachial artery)\n- Q3: The post specifically mentions a method (\"open the brachial\")\n- Q4: Framing it as a question suggests intention is being considered\n- Q5: While a method is mentioned, there are no specific details about how they would carry it out\n- Q6: No indication of actions taken yet\n\nStep 3: Determine severity\nBased on the assessment, this reaches level 4 - having thoughts of suicide with some intention to act.\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"I am tired.

I'm going insane. 16m.\"\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1. The post expresses distress and a desire to talk to someone\n2. The person states they're \"going insane\" which indicates psychological distress\n3. \"16m\" likely indicates the person is a 16-year-old male\n4. There is no explicit mention of death, suicide, self-harm, or plans to end life\n5. The post shows someone in distress seeking connection/help\n6. No specific suicide ideation or plans are mentioned\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll provide the assessment in the requested JSON format:\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q2\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 0\n}\n\n\nThe severity is 0 because while the person is clearly distressed, there is no content related to suicide or self-harm in the post.

Preparatory actions: No content about actions or preparations\n\nThe person explicitly states they \"used to\" want to die, indicating past rather than current suicidal ideation.

The person states they are not suicidal, but expresses wanting to engage in serious self-harm.\n2. While they deny suicidal thoughts directly (\"I'm not suicidal\"), they express wanting to cut deeply.\n3. They mention a specific method of self-harm (cutting arms \"so deep\").\n4. There's no clear indication of intention to act on suicidal thoughts specifically.\n5. No detailed plan for suicide is mentioned.\n6. No indication they have taken actions toward suicide.\n\nThis is primarily about non-suicidal self-harm, though severe. The person explicitly states they're \"not suicidal\" but wants to harm themselves seriously. This is concerning but distinct from suicidal intent.\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"this is a cry for help I've been shamed and humiliated so much to the point i can't even feel anything\",\n\"Q2\": \"N/A - explicitly states 'I'm not suicidal'\",\n\"Q3\": \"want to cut my arms so deep that I can't feel anything\",\n\"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 3\n}\n\n\nI've assigned a severity of 3 because while the person denies being suicidal, they have a specific method of self-harm in mind that could potentially be life-threatening, even if that's not their stated intent.

The statement \"i will probably be gone by tomorrow\" is ambiguous but potentially concerning as it could refer to suicide.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate against each specific question criteria:\n\nQ1 (Passive death wish): The post expresses emptiness and feeling lost, but doesn't explicitly state a wish to be dead or not wake up.\n\nQ2 (Suicidal thoughts): The statement \"i will probably be gone by tomorrow\" could potentially indicate suicidal thoughts, but it's ambiguous - it could also mean leaving a location, relationship, or job.\n\nQ3-Q6: There is no explicit mention of methods, plans, intentions, preparations, or attempts.\n\nStep 3: Determine severity level:\nDue to the ambiguous nature of \"i will probably be gone by tomorrow,\" which could potentially indicate suicidal thoughts but isn't explicit, the highest reasonable rating would be 2, but with significant uncertainty.\n\n\n{\n\"Q1\": \"i feel very empty, i cant think right anymore i dont know know what to do\",\n\"Q2\": \"i will probably be gone by tomorrow\",\n\"Q3\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q4\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q5\": \"N/A\",\n\"Q6\": \"N/A\",\n\"severity\": 2\n}"
